Entrance Ramp~
The Infiltrator Class Fighter, was one of the first ships ever developed by
Kintar Enterprises. It was noted for it's resilence and speed in the early
days of the Imperial Remnant's strides to re-establish themselves as a force
in the galaxy. The Infiltrator was designed for the transport of small elite
Teams, and insertion into hostile worlds.

Cockpit~
The cockpit of the Infiltrator Class Fighter contains one of the most advanced
flight systems available. The sleek, streamlined appearance is done in typical
Kintar Enterprises style, giving the ship's interior the same lethal and
efficient style characterized by the exterior of the vessel. A single pilots
chair sits dead center of the console. Several smaller displays with vital
ship statistics on them wait perched around the chair, ready to move down into
place when the ship is powered up for launch.

The Passenger's Lounge~
The passenger lounge aboard the Infilitrator leaves much to be desired. Stark,
black deck plating lines the walls and floors. 4 sleeping tubes line the two
small walls. While this room may be functional for getting some rest in, it's
certainly not designed for comfort. The bleak appearance just helps round off
the overall ship. This vessel was obviously made for combat, and could serve
no other possible purpose.

This corridor is brightly lit and smells of Ryloth. The Senator prefers his
ship scented to remind him of his home planet. He spends so much time away
from Ryloth, he doesn't want to forget the people he is serving. This ship's
interior serves as a reminder of that.

are easy enough however so that the Senator doesn't waste tax dollars hiring a
pilot to fly him arond, he flies the ship himself.

Cockpit~
&cThis is the cockpit area of the ship. This area houses all control
interfaces and surfaces for any manuvers or any type of change in the
ship. From barrell rolls to jukes to changing the temperature to something
more comfortable for the occupants. This is also where all the action
occurs during battle, for this area is also the place where all targeting
and gunnery is done as well.

A Small Engineering Workshop~
&cThis is a small Imperial workshop on this ship. Here engineers can do so
pre-battle engineering work for troops or make the supplies necessary to
wage war on planets far off. There is an ample amount of power supplies
here to power any tools or heating devices that may be needed for various
engineering products and crafts.

The Engine Room~
&rThis is the engine room to the ship. The cold fusion reactor makes sure
that the room temperature never exceeds the average temperature. The
reactor hums as it creates power to give life to all the ships systems.
This one reactor powers everything on the ship. From the shields, to the
lasers, to the ships main sub-light drive and Hyper space drives. The
source of power originates from here.

A Small Alcove~
&cThis is the main resting and lounge area for the ships crew. It has nice
blue carpeting and the walls are a more aesthetically pleasing color.
Numerous tables and chairs are around for weary crew and passengers. There
are even a few small beds for those who wish to take a quick nap in
between shifts but not return to their quarters.

Turret~
&gA large turbo laser turret is here. These turrets are extremely large,
and require a small crew to maintain and fire them, as well as target
opponents. The turret interface is here as well, providing an inefficient,
but easy one man way to man the turret. Numerous energy cells lie around
to replace the spent ones from the turbo laser.

An Empty Home~
&BThis is one of the crew's quarters. It is nicely furnished for a small
room made only for one occupant. It has a nice sized bed, with holo-net
access on the nightstand next to it. It also has a small kitchenette for
the occupant. However, it does not have it's own refresher unit, one would
have to go to the main refresher units on the ship for relief or
refreshing.

A Small Landing Bay~
&cThis is the hanger area of the ship, which is heavily occupied with
mechanics and other personel. T.I.E. Fighters, Bombers, and defenders are
all in holding racks here, being prepared for launch. The smell of
starship fuel and grease fills the air, and numerous spills of these
various substances stain the durasteel deck, making a very appealing look
to the area.

end a day then to float in a bath of bacta? Especially after fighting long,
hard battles with vicious criminals.&D

Entrance Ramp~
The entry hatch on the rain dancer is pretty much just a small, short link
between workshop and cockpit. The space itself is intruded upon by guages and
pipes, making the space feel more cramped than it is. The edges, and the look,
are softened however by a coating of low-resistance duraplast that gives the
whole ship a softer feel.

Cockpit~
The cockpit of the rain dancer is pretty plush, as cockpits go. The displays
and consoles all have rounded edging made out of low-resistance duraplast,
giving them a soft look and feel. The pilots seat is surrounded by easy to
reach controls that allow one person to effectively manuever the ship.

A Workshop~
The workshop of the rain dancer is by far the most utilarian room on the ship.
A small work bench and a colapsable stool, along with tools locked into the
wall, allow such a small ship to have a fully functional area for making small
items. The distinct smell of oxygenated durasteel permeates the room, and
spots of oil are splattered in places around the room.

Entrance Ramp~
A long ramp is here, that can be lowered to allow
enterance to the ship.  To the fore section of the
ship is a corridor that leads towards the cockpit.
Towards the aft of the ship is a turbolift that
leads towards the hanger and engine room.  A
ladder located to one side of this room leads
towards a turret.

This turbolift appears to be kept in

of the ship, the cockpit and crew
quarters are located.  The engine room,
medical area, and hanger are on the
lower level.  The upper level is
mostly made up of a viewing area.

bacta tank, and on the other side is a
cramped workspace.  A ladder also leads
down to a turret.

Brain of the Mynock~
This is the cockpit of the Crippled Mynock. Despite the name, the ship
actually looks alright inside. Alright, if you can ignore the exposed
wiring in some places, and the poorly welded plastisteel patches. On the
control panel, there is taped a picture of a cute redhead girl. The
picture seems worn, like it has been carried around lovingly. In the
corner of the room is a holo, that when activated, shows the cute redhead
from the picture in a tight shirt with a deeply plunging neckline, a green
neckerchief, white gloves that come just over the elbow, and a very short,
ruffled green skirt. The power button on the holo seems very worn.

Entrance Ramp~
The entrance ramp of this Light Cruiser is remarkably non-descript. The walls
are scrubbed clean and glaringly white. The faint smell of disinfectant hangs
in the air belaying a sense of painstaking cleanliness. As you continue to
look around the ship you notice the cleaning droids zipping about, keeping the
environment sterile.

Cockpit~
You are sitting in the cockpit of a KabackEnterprises Rayfighter. The
comfortable pilot seat is positioned in a transparisteel bubble set
into the nose of the craft, giving you an excellent view of your
surroundings. The wings of the fighter sweep back on either side of the
canopy, forming the shape of the Calamarian creature that gives the
ship its name. Small maneuvering jets are positioned on the craft's
wingtips, enhancing its agility. You feel confident that this able
craft would hold its own even in the toughest dogfights.

Cockpit~
This is the cockpit of the Dreamworks Engineering designed Jedi
Starfighter. The craft is modled somewhat after the older Jedi
Starfighters used by the Jedi Order in the days of the Old Republic. Due
to the advance of modern hyperdrives however these jedi starfighters
unlike their counterparts have built in hyperdrives. The cockpit is
comprised of a rather comfortable seat, a bubble canopy and a control
system. On the left side of the control system is a throttle mechanism and
in the center is a control stick for guiding the craft. There is a top of
the line radar and targeting system installed into the control system.
There are also many other controls that perform various functions.

Cockpit~
This is the cockpit of the Dreamworks Engineering designed Jedi
Starfighter. The craft is modled somewhat after the older Jedi
Starfighters used by the Jedi Order in the days of the Old Republic. Due
to the advance of modern hyperdrives however these jedi starfighters
unlike their counterparts have built in hyperdrives. The cockpit is
comprised of a rather comfortable seat, a bubble canopy and a control
system. On the left side of the control system is a throttle mechanism and
in the center is a control stick for guiding the craft. There is a top of
the line radar and targeting system installed into the control system.
There are also many other controls that perform various functions.

Cockpit~
This is the cockpit of the Dreamworks Engineering designed Jedi
Starfighter. The craft is modled somewhat after the older Jedi
Starfighters used by the Jedi Order in the days of the Old Republic. Due
to the advance of modern hyperdrives however these jedi starfighters
unlike their counterparts have built in hyperdrives. The cockpit is
comprised of a rather comfortable seat, a bubble canopy and a control
system. On the left side of the control system is a throttle mechanism and
in the center is a control stick for guiding the craft. There is a top of
the line radar and targeting system installed into the control system.
There are also many other controls that perform various functions.

Cockpit~
This is the cockpit of the Dreamworks Engineering designed Jedi
Starfighter. The craft is modled somewhat after the older Jedi
Starfighters used by the Jedi Order in the days of the Old Republic. Due
to the advance of modern hyperdrives however these jedi starfighters
unlike their counterparts have built in hyperdrives. The cockpit is
comprised of a rather comfortable seat, a bubble canopy and a control
system. On the left side of the control system is a throttle mechanism and
in the center is a control stick for guiding the craft. There is a top of
the line radar and targeting system installed into the control system.
There are also many other controls that perform various functions.

CCC-01 Cerberus's Gangway~
There are two medium hydraulic lifts on either side of the ramp here. The ramp
itself has been constructed to hold nearly 100 metric tons but can only close
with a little under 1.5 metric tons still on it. The center of the ramp's
covering has been worn away from heavy use. The outer edges of the ramp have
been stained from previous hydraulic fluid leaks and are still damp from more
recent leaks. The sound of pressurizing hydraulics can easily be heard over
the sound of the Cerberus's engines. A hatch to port leads up to the
Cerberus's lowest corridor.

A Corridor Near the Hanger~
This is one of the main corridors of the Cerberus carrier. This corridor runs
about half of the length of the carrier and connects the hanger to the rest of
the ship. The flooring of this corridor is bare durasteel. The sounds of
hydraulic systems can be heard from below and the scent of fighter fuel drifts
along from the hanger. A hatch to starboard down to the loading hatch.

The Cerberus's Flightdeck~
This is the Cerberus's only hanger. Towards the bow of the craft are two large
hanger doors and magnetic containment field generators. Past the doors a
runway large enough to land a large freighter without assistance can be seen.
The smell of high grade fighter and freighter fuel permeates the entire
hanger. Fighter sized slots are ranged along the port bulkhead with cranes to
move some of the more cumbersome fighters to and from the runway. Along the
starboard bulkhead a similar setup but large enough to hold freighters
instead.

A Small Workshop~
This is the Cerberus's workshop. Here any of off-duty crewmen or passengers may
work on their projects, presuming they brought the required materials and
tools with them. Discarded bits and foul ups are strewn across the deck. There
are engineering workbenches along the bow wall and the bow halves of the port
and starboard walls. There are two adjustable maniquins for sizing pouches and
armour. There are blaster burns near both of the blaster testing targets.

Crew and Passenger Quarters~
The Crew Quarters are adequate for a medium length trip. While containing
fairly decent furnishing the crew spends a good deal of their time here,
probably due to the fact that the alternative is to be on duty. Along part of
starboard wall is an extremely large cold storage chest to hold perishable
goods. Along the rest of the wall is an even larger cupboard containing
emergency ship rations. There are fourteen bunks with lockers at either end of
them.

Entrance Ramp for the Shadows Dagger~
The Entrance Ramp for the Shadows Dagger is medium in size, and could easily
fit 4 full grown male humans side by side coming into the ship or
leaving.Along the wall is a railing, with rifle holders just above them. The
floor is covered in a high-traction material, and the top of it is empty, to
allow for for people to come through with their rifles held up high.

Corridor to the Cockpit of the Shadows Dagger~
The corridor to and from the cockpit is almost spartan, save for a door with a
lock on it. The floor is covered in the same material as the entrance ramp,
but lacks the same railings. A few panets are mounted in the sides of the
corridor, displaying some information about the ship, and mission information
if any is available.

A Cockpit~
Designed for efficency, this cockpit sports some of the highest quality
equipment. The cockpit is shaped like a wedge almost, with the controls
forming a 'U' shape around the pilot or pilots. Along the west side of the
controls, there are some odd looking levers, almost like they were added
afterwards. The door to the cockpit appears to have a lock on it, helping to
keep the flight crew safe.

Main Interstion and Lift to Turrets~
The hallway splits off into 2 more directions here, and a pair of lifts go to
the turrets located above and below this corridor. A backup ladder is located
next to each, in case the lift loses power or malfunctions. Under normal
circumstances, this corridor would be pretty busy, being the main corridor
through the ship, and providing access to the other areas.

Turret~
The turret provides a large area of fire, including overlapping cover with the
lower turret and main weapon systems of the ship. The weapons control and
targetting system appear to be of good design, with backup systems available
should the primary systems be damaged. This particular turret provides cover
for the lower sections of the ship, and can give an almost unobstructed area
of fire for ships using the hanger.

Lift to Barracks and Engineroom~
This corridor is lined with high-density materials, and a pair of heavy-duty
lifts, allowing the enginerring crew to bring in larger parts for the engine,
or to replace it entirely. Another lift, the same size but not meant for large
machines is in position to take people to the upper levels. To the east is a
set of Private Quarters.

Upper Barracks Hall~
The Upper Barracks Mess floor is covered in what appears to be an extra thick
layer of high-traction material, but still appears to have been wore down by
constant use. In every corner of the room, there are couches and holovids,
even the occasional game, providing the troops stationed onboard some
entertainment during trips. In the north-east corner however, is a small food
dispensor, providing a somewhat meager assortment of meals.

The semicirclular room is neatly organized and decorated, making it a

encircling a round marble table. Grounded in the center of the room is a
nav display console, obviously linked directly to the ships nav computer
as it displays a holo of the ships destined system, giving ample light to
the room as it does so. Small rectangular lights are installed near the
top of the wall and follow around the western curve and eastern flat-wall
to assure a lighted and comfortable environment.

Cockpit~
An array of computer terminals, levers, and buttons make up the dashboard
of the relativly small cockpit. Twin leather seats, separated by an
extending terminal running between them, bolt to the clean durasteel
flooring. A transparisteel viewport rises from the back of the dashboard
and subtly fades into the ships solid hull above it.

A Corridor~
The small area branches off directly below the cockpit via a black
durasteel ladder and leads to the ship's two quad cannons. Adopting all
its light from the turret stations themselves, it remains mostly darkened,
having no other purpose other than getting to the weapons, easily
accessible from the cockpit so the Captain himself can partake in the
combat if necessary.

Entrance Ramp~
The portal to the outside world is here, covered in thick, black carpet.
Two repulsorlift sleds are strapped to the walls for any cargo that needs
to be placed inside the habitable part of the ship without damaging the
carpet. Soft blue lights illuminate the passageway north to the main areas
of the ship, and south into the engine room.

The Engine Room~
This is the pulsing heart of the Stormcrow. Engine machinery lines the
walls and juts out from the floor and ceiling, creating a complicated
maze. Blue-glowing status displays are the only light source other than
the overhead strips of white lights. In the center of the room, dominating
every other piece of machinery and extending from floor to ceiling, is a
brand-new reactor core, custom produced for the ship by the DreamWorks
company.

Corridor~
You are standing in the central hub of the ship. The defense turrets fixed
to the ends of the wings can be reached by going east or west, as can the
hanger, workshop, and medical bay. If you leave south, you can exit the
ship or obtain access to the engine room. North lies the cockpit, the
captain's quarters, and the passenger lounge.

Corridor~
You are in the starboard wing of the Stormcrow. South is the ship's
well-appointed medical area, and further down the corridor is one of the
two defense turrets the ship comes equipped with. The carpet remains
black, and the lighting blue, except where it gives way to the white tile
and walls of the medical center.

Medical Bay~
You have entered the Stormcrow's small but well-equipped medical bay. It
has two beds for sick patients, an operating table with a toggleable
opaque force-screen, and a bacta tank in an alcove in the wall. The walls
are painted white with a dark red stripe running around the room at waist
height. The floor is made of non-slip white tile. Glaring white overhead
lights reflect off of the sterile bags of instruments next to each bed.

transparisteel bubble.

strips behind the gunner's seat, giving him light to see his controls, but
nothing to shine in his or her - or anything else's - eyes.

back to the rest of the ship. The door to the captain's quarters is almost
always locked, and it has a sign on it reading Captain Elser .

The Passenger's Lounge~
The circle-shaped room has a small fireplace in the center, letting a jet
of flame issue forth. The flame is some of the non-radioactive excess
energy of the ship's reactor core. There is a bar that curves along with
the shape of the wall it is against. Behind the bar, you can see a
magnificent view through four large transparisteel viewports dominating
the entire wall.

This is the captain's inner sanctum. As of right now, the room belongs to
Captain Elser, serving as a home and a traveling office both for when he
is away from Gornus. There is a painting hung on the wall of the
Coruscanti skyline at night.

Cockpit~
This is the command center of the Grey Stormcrow. All the ship's control
are accessible from a single pilot's chair, but there is also a co-pilot's
chair with duplicate controls. The two consoles are seperate by the
control bank inbetween. Looking forward, you can see out of the
transparisteel viewport that curves around the front of the ship.

Corridor~
The blue lights compete and fail miserably with the well-lit docking bay to
the south, whenever the large double sliding door is open. However, it
stays closed most of the time, allowing the pedestrians to continue down
the black-carpeted hallway to the workshop or turret in their soft
blue-lit enviroment.

The Hanger~
The docking bay of the Stormcrow is all white painted durasteel walls.
There are various notices and signs on the walls, alerting you to things
such as fuel ports or tool closets. Starfighters that land on the ship are
either kept in racks against the wall or from the ceiling, or on the
docking bay floor itself. The thick durasteel doors that guard the docking
bay from space are supplemented by a shimmering blue force shield.

Corridor~
You are almost at the end of the port wing of the ship. Only the bubble-tip
of the defensive turret is left before you reach the very end. To your
south is a door, with a sign on it reading 'Workshop'. You can either go
into the turret, into the workshop, or back down the corridor.

A Workshop~
This small, quiet room is near the end of the port-side wing. It has a trio
of benches, one against every wall except the one with the door. Each
workbench has a set of basic tools and power supplies, but for anything
complex you'll need your own set of more comprehensive tools.
