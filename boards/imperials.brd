For all those wishing to join The Grand Empire, there are a few things that
are necessary to apply. First you must contact Grand Admiral Reaban, or
one of his subordinates. Then you must send an application over the
holo-net mail system. On this mail there should be a list of things.
1. Your Race, and age in basic years.
2. Your name and home planet.
3. Your field of interest and desired branch.
4. A brief history of yourself, and reasons why you wish to join the
Empire.
5. A statement that you agree to all imperial laws concurrently and in the
future.
 
That is all that is required in the mail. The branches of course are Naval,
Star Fighter Corps, Army, and Diplomatic Corps. Field of interest is
whatever you want to do in the branch.

Hello, leaders of the Imperial Remants, congratulations for your succsess on
remaking the Empire
I am presenting my war, and my final-goals:
I am declaring war againts "The New Republic", and these are the reasons:
The Republic does not allow trade of weapons
The Republic does not allow movement of weapons inside Coruscant boundaries
The Republic controls most of Coruscant which is the capital of the galaxy
The Republic hunts members of the Sith - p.s Somebody has a risk of
assasination
The Republic does not understand true alignments, they kill "evil" people
without giving a trial
The Republic isn't a good ruler of Coruscant - I am about to change that
 
These are the Requests:
Three very skilled bounty hunters
One very skilled combatant
One very skilled engineer
Two very skilled pilots
One very skilled leader
Two starfighters of the S-X models (From S-32 and above)
One big ship
 
I am requesting funds for my war, I cannot succseed without function without
proper weapons and funds
And finnally, I hope you can lend me some battalions
 
Thanks in Advance
p.s To: Dark Lord Of Sith
I will appreciate your assistance if you will assist
