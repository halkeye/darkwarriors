I, Migran Delor, hereby pledge myself to The New Republic, after enlisting
with the recruitment officers, and do swear to uphold the laws and morals
of The New Republic. 
 
This includes needless violence and murder. As such, I will send any person
caught murdering on Coruscant to jail, where they can be rehabilitated.
 
I emplore the citizens of Coruscant to band together to stop this murderous
rampage, and to defend yourselves as best you can. 
 
Sincerely, 
Migran Delor 
Officer of The New Republic

Denizens of the Galaxy, members of the New Republic, and of the Empire.  I
am supposedly once leader of the New Republic Jaffel.  I awoke from a
cloning chamber approximately a week ago.  Since then I have become
uncertain of everything.   I let out a thank you to thoose who have
attempted to help, but I fear now that I am beyond it.  Im not sure what
way to turn, who I can trust.  In fact I say to you now that I am not sure
now even about my apparent past convictions towards the Republic's cause. 
 My head is spinning, and it has no where logical to stop.  I fear that I
may have been wrong when I choose the New Republic, but the Empire as
charming as its leader is, still has a bad ring to it.   Even now I am not
sure I am doing the right thing, but it is the only thing I can do. 
People of the New Republic, I have not yet walked back on my commitment to
your cause, yet I cannot join your fine organization until I spend some
time reflecting.   Not just on good and bad, right and wrong.  But the
inner workings of the universe, why am I here, and what is my purpose.   I
have decided to seek the wise and noble Jedi Master Luke Skywalker, I will
spend as much time there as it takes me to decide my fate.   As a notice
to all people of both parties in the New Republic and Empire, I will
destroy my comlink, and ignore any messages that I recieve by other means.
  Maybe, hopefully sooner rather than later I will be able to make the
choice, and the right one for me and for you.   I ask my successor in the
New Republic to come to me and tell me the status of the New Republic when
they deem neccessary.  And I ask for Teyd the Emperor, that if he seeks my
attention he meets me in person as well.
~
