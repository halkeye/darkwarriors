&W Player killing is legal on Dark Warriors. However please note the
following:
 
If you kill a player who doesn't have a bounty on their head and isn't
themselves wanted you will get a &RWanted for Murder&W tag after your name
as it appears on the who list.
 
This doesn't affect your character in any way ... however killing someone
who has that flag is rewarded with the much sought after bounty hunting
experience.
 
So be warned if you kill you will probably be hunted by a lot of people.
 
please note:
 
Newbie killing is discouraged. In fact, newbie killing is strictly forbidden.
If you kill a newbie, anyone under level 6, that is, you will be slayed.
Killing MUST be kept in character or yours will be slain.

1 A~
.                MOVING THROUGHOUT GAME:
                ---------------------------
The game divided into many rooms that are connected by various
direction to make up areas.  When you are in a room, you can
find the exits in the room by typing EXITS.  Autoexit is a helpful
command to initiate (type CONFIG +AUTOEXIT), because it will
automatically show you what exits there are in the room.  Be warned
however, you will only see the obvious exits.  You must pay attention
to the room descriptions to see if there might be any doors or hidden
passages in the room. 

Directional commands: (in parentheses you find the shorthand)
NORTH (n)    SOUTH (s)    EAST (e)    WEST (w)     UP (u)     DOWN (d)
NORTHEAST (Ne)  NORTHWEST (Nw)  SOUTHEAST (Se)  SOUTHWEST (Sw)
 
Note:  You will notice that in the prompt <20hp 10bp 20mv>, the 'mv'
       refers to your movement points.  If your movement points were
       to run out, you will be unable to move between rooms due to 
       exhaustion.  If you type SLEEP or REST your movement points will
       slowly be replenished.  You must type STAND or WAKE before 
       walking again.

To save changes permanently, type "aassign none" and foldarea.
 
Warning!! Do not have an area aassigned to yourself when getting personal
vnums assigned to you.  The personal vnums will overwrite the area file.
 
In order to assign a proto area to yourself, you must either have that
area bestowed to you or you must be Greater God+.
 
In order to assign a nonproto area to yourself, you must either have
that area bestowed to you by a member of the Area Council or you must
be Exalted+. Even if you have the area bestowed to you, only Lesser+
can assign themselves nonproto areas.

0 ADARI ADARIAN~
an alien race native to the planet Adari, the Adarians are humanoids with 
unusual cranial structures. Their skulls are elongated and tall, and have a 
large hole, which goes completely through it. They have no ears or noses, and 
their mouth is ringed with sharp, bony ridges instead of lips. The Adarians 
make up to the lack of ears with a covering of fine hairs along their skulls 
that picks up the vibration of sound waves. A series of glands near the skin's 
surface allows them to smell. Their throats can be distended and filled with 
air, and the resulting "long call" can be useful as a communication method or a 
kind of defensive action. The Adarians have a rigid caste system which 
dominates their society, and the have evolved an advanced technology based on 
the use of super-cooled carbon-ice computers. They were able to remain neutral 
during the Galactic Civil War by signing a non-aggression treaty with the 
Empire, providing the Empire with unlimited raw materials in return for their 
neutrality.

-----Playing an Adarian-----
Due to their neutrality, Adarians can be found on either side of the war between
rebel and imperial. Their nature is neither good nor evil, but they tend to be
pacifistic either way, furthering their causes by debate rather than violence.
As a race they pride themselves on their intelligence, and shun those that are
less so. They also tend to be very rigid about class and societal status.

101 ADVANCEDEXITS~
SMAUG supports having more than one exit in the same direction,
as well as the special direction 'somewhere', represented by a '?'.
 
If you already have an exit leading north, and would like another one,
use a plus sign '+' in front of the direction:
redit exit +n 3001          - Adds another exit north to room 3001
 
To modify an extra exit like this, or to remove it, you'll have to
refer to it by number:
redit exit #2 3002          - Change the second exit to go to room 3002
 
To know what number an exit is, do an "rstat".
 
For someone to be able to use the second north exit, you have to set one
of the extra flags (see EXFLAGS) like CAN_CLIMB.  It is also usually a good
idea to set the HIDDEN flag for any special exit so that it looks nicer
with autoexits on.
 
The AUTO flag makes it possible to go in a direction by simply typing the
keyword for that exit:
redit exit ? 3001           - Create a 'somewhere' exit to 3001
redit exflags ? auto hidden - Set the proper flags
redit exname ? swim         - Set the keyword "swim"
If a player types 'swim' in the room, they will move to room 3001.

0 AFFECTED 'AFFECTED BY'~
Syntax:  affected       (abbreviation:  af)
Syntax:  affected by    (abbreviation: af by)
 
'Affected' is a powers-at-a-glance function, which displays only the powers
(and skill affects) your character is currently under.  Each affect will be
listed by name only for the sake of brevity (if you want to know what each
is doing, use help <power/skill name> or 'score').
 
Characters level 20 or above and deadly characters will also see the number
of rounds remaining for each affect.  Affects with a remaining lifespan of
less than 25 rounds are displayed in white, and those in immediate danger
of wearing off will flash.
 
'Affected by' displays a character's affects separate from its power/skill
affect list.  This is useful for ensuring that affects given from equipment
are actually functioning.  For example, if you are wearing a visor with
detect_invis but 'affected by' does not show you as having that affect, you
are not detecting invisibility.
 
'Affected by' also displays your current susceptibilities, resistances and
immunities if your character is level 20 or higher.

        &Galias &C<&calias&C> delete
        &Galias &C<&calias&C> show&w

The ALIAS command allows you to set shortcuts for ommands or long strings of
text. These can be quite useful for shortenng routinely entered commands.
 
Aliases also accept arguments now. These argument let you make your aliases
much more dynamic. Here is an example of an alias:

alias moocow create
say Hello, I'm a cow.
moo
sayto $1 Am I a good cow?
sayto $2 $2 says I am a good cow!
 
This creates an alias called moocow . The $X will be replacd with arguments to
the moocow alias. As such:
 
moocow halkeye greven
You say, 'Hello, I'm a cow.'
You beg for money, weapons, coins.
You ask Halkeye Pierce, 'Am I a good cow?'
You exclaim at Greven'il'Vec, 'greven says I am a good cow!'
 
Alias will support argument $1 through $9

101 ALLOW BAN~
Syntax:  allow <site>
Syntax:  ban   <site>
Syntax:  ban
Syntax:  ban <# of ban on ban list> level <level of char to ban and below>
 
BAN <site> prohibits players from that site from logging in.
 
BAN with no arguments returns an enumerated list of banned sites.
 
To set a specific level of character to ban from a site, use 'ban' to get
the list number of the banned site and then use 'ban level'.
Example:  ban 2 level 10
 
This will ban all characters level 10 and under from the second site on
the 'ban' list.
 
ALLOW <site> removes a site from the ban list.
 
The site ban test works by suffix comparison, so if you ban 'foo.edu',
all sites within 'foo.edu' are banned as well.

          FAIL     -This argument allows you to voluntarily quit your 
                     quest. 
An example of how the questing system would work: 

        First once entering where a quest master is, you would AQUEST
REQUEST. then the questmaster will proceed to tell you the quest. Once you
finish the quest return to the quest mater and type AQUEST COMPLETE. You
have now finished a quest! 

When buying hit points, you can get up to 300 additional hit points.

&RSyntax: &Gchallenge &C<&ccharacter&C>

&RSyntax: &Gchallenge &C<&caccept&C/&cdecline&C>
&RSyntax: &Gbet &C<&cfighter&C> &C<&camount&C>&W
&w
The arena is a set of code that allows two players to have a battle. These
battles are considered in character. When a challenge is announced, the target
has a chance to accept or decline. If the target does not respond, the
challenge will be cancelled, the same as if they were to decline.
 
If the target accept, both the target and the challenger will be sent to the
arena. Here they will wait a short time while other players may place bets on
the winner.
 
When the time comes for the battle, both combatants will be put into the fight.
During this fight, character will not die, nor will their equipment be damaged.
 
When one of the combatants is defeated (is taken below 0 hit points), the
battle will be finished. The combatants will be restored, and returned to where
they were.
 
At this time, are credits bet on the winner are removed from the pool. One half
of the remaining credits(anything bet on the loser) are devided evenly amongst
all winning bets, and is paid to the betters, along with their original
capital. The other half of the remaining pot goes to the winner of the battle.
 
As an addition, you can challenge people to an OOC battle. All battles
involving an immortal are considered OOC. There is no betting on OOC battles.

0 ASSISTANT~
Welcome to the Assistant

This help file is here to help those who doesn't know this codebase
or even those who are new to mudding

Introduction to the Smaug - Diku codebase:
Smaug is a very well known codebase,
it's the father of the most sub-codebases around,
there are fewest basic commands in this codebase:
12 directions (8 compass + Up, Down, Enter, Leave)
the 8 compass directions are simple as they sound, 
typing them will get you to the room in that direction (if it exist)

up + down are additional directions used widely in turbo-lifts, caves
secret areas etc. their usage is the same as the usage of the 8 compass,

enter and leave are more complicated (but not so), some rooms
are item based, like bacta tank, you enter the bacta tank and then
you can leave it (e.g "enter tank" -- "leave tank")

There are four modes that your charecter can be:
Stand - regular, can move, can fight etc...
Sit - can't move, regain HP slowly, ready for battle
Rest - can't move, regain HP faster, relaxed; not ready for battle
Sleep - can't move, regain HP fastest, can't see and can't hear anything,
    not ready for battle
Wake - not a mode, it just a command that orders your charecter to wake
  it may also wake up other sleeping charecters (e.g "wake sleeping-cat")
*not ready for battle - he has a disadvantage in the first attack
 
Your charecter may open doors (or gates, or anything openable)
('help open' for more info)

Type "help assistant2" to continue

0 ASSISTANT2~
Your charecter may wear and remove clothing, items or weapons:
Remove works for all
Wield, Wear, Hold works the same
(e.g wear belt, hold belt, wield belt <-- all the same, rem belt <-- removes
   the belt)

Your charecter may also fight and flee:
Kill [target] - used when you are killing a mob or a player
Flee - used if you want to flee from battle (run away)
    Not always work
Murder (*Special command) - used if you want to murder a player
    The difference is between death and stunned

Type "help thirsty" to get help about charecter's feeding

That's all the basic commands in this code-base,
there are also plenty of other commands which you should learn by yourself
(help help, help prac, help score, help skills)

This mud is RP based, ("help roleplay")
Thanks for reading the Assistant, I hope it helped
("help mudding" if all of the above confuze you)

3 AUCTION~
Syntax: auction 
Syntax:	auction <item name> <starting value>
Syntax:	auction bid <value>
Syntax:	auction stop

The auction command is used for performing auctions.  Simply typing 
auction will display the current item being auctioned, if there is one.  

If nothing is being auctioned, auction <item name> <starting value> will 
begin an auction.  If no starting value is specified, it will start at 0 
gold.

Auction bid <value> will place a bet for the item, and 
auction stop (immortals only) will stop an auction in progress. 

Special thanks to Erwin Andreasen for writing this function.
(Ported here from a publicly available source.)

At the present, if the mud crashes in mid auction, you will lose both 
your bid money and the item.  This will soon be fixed.
 
You are able to see auction almost from the point of character creation,
however, you cannot USE auction until level THREE or higher.  To remove
the auction channel from your screen, type CHANNEL -AUCTION.

consequences are inflicted on your opponent if it is a player character,
otherwise the skill only inflicts damage.

1 BATTALION BATTALIONS~
Batallions are a way for clans to wage planetary warfare on another clan.
Basically, here's the idea: Clan A "recruits", using the recruit skill, X
amount of batallions on a planet that they own and control. These become
"defending battalions",  viewable from the "planets" command. Using the
"load_batallions" command, you can transfer them from the planet to a
acceptable ship, one with a "maxbatallion" stat. You then fly this ship to
the planet, land, and use the command "deploy_batallions". This will do
one of two things: If you own the planet, it will add the amount that you
deploy to the "defending battalion" variable of the planet. If you do NOT
own the planet, it will add the amount to the "Attacking  Battalions"
variable, as well as initiate some update code. Now, this is all
automatic, but depending on how many people of what clan are on the
planet, the pop support of that planet, orbiting ship, etc., each side of
the battle will lose battalions, the amount dependant on the said
conditions. When attacking reaches 0, the planet is defended and the
battle ends. When defending reaches 0, the planet is capture, and the
attacking battalions become defending battalions for the new government.
Many ideas and plans will go into effect, including: expanding the types of
battalions, diplo/leader skill, money,  taxes, etc. And ideas, please use
the "idea" command.

153 BINARY~
Droids: Binary

The primary communication of droids and robots throughout the star wars
universe, essentially, code and binary files are information and commands
stored and used by hardware and software in their most elemental form--strings
of on-off signals to an electronic processor. Many systems of binary encoding
of data and commands are proprietary and unique to particular hardware and
software systems. They are usually the most compact means of storing data, and
commands stored in binary form can execute very rapidly, but binary files
often are difficult to transfer between differing computer systems. Often
binary files are translated into ASCII form for transfer between computers.

1 BIND~
Syntax: bind <victim> <code>

Using this command will cause your character to bind your victim with 
whatever manner of bindings you are HOLDING. Code is optional, if your 
binding doesn't have a keypad specifying a code makes no difference. 
You can set the code when you bind someone, or once they are wearing 
it using SETCODE. If no code is specified on a keypad binding it will 
pysical restraint (GRAB) and subdued (low endurance).

152 BINDINGS~
Bindings have special values assigned to their v0-v4 spots. The way they
are made is quite simple, after one has made one. Thus, this help file
will serve as a step-by-step guide. First off, make the item. Set the wear
flags of TAKE and HOLD. Next, assign it a short name. This name will be
used in actions, and will really determine the nature of the binding. Some
bindings have keypads (that will be explained shortly), while others are
not mechanical binders, they are more like rope used to lash ones arms
together. Lets make a rope, we will assume that it is not very strong. The
v0 value is only important if you wish to make the item un-breakable
(through struggling). If you give it a value of 100, it will be
indestructable, but it is not needed for a simple rope. Next, v1
determines the resistance. Some materials are stronger than others, and
this emulates that. Try to keep the range between 0 and 8, for the sake of
balance. Next, v2 is the durability. Some things are hard, and would have
a v1 that is high, but are brittle and thus may have a v2 that is low. Try
to keep one high, the other low, if possible, simply to prevent
uber-bindings from running amok. Each time someone struggles, their effort
is taken, the v1 is subtracted from it, and the result is subtracted from
v2 of the binding. After time, the binding will break. The minimum that
struggling will do is 1, so keep that in mind. Next, v3 should be left
blank on index objects, because this is the code for the keypad on the
binding. We are making a rope, so this isn't pertinent. v4 is either 0 or
1, a 1 indicates that the binding has a keypad. This is all that you need
to set up a basic item, and if you wish to add the complexity of a keypad
to certain bindings, v3 is where the key code is kept. Some times you may
wish to have a mob in a certain area bound, whose key code is discoverable
through the course of the game. In this case, you would set the code to
v3, and set v4 to 1. Bindings are easy to understand, if you have patience
and examine the situation, and perhaps you will find them to be much more
adaptable than you had first thought, once you understand them.
 
For further clarification, ask Ulthrax, or any other coder.

1 'BIOTIPS' BTIPS 'BIO TIPS' 'WRITING A BIO'~
When creating a character you should have some idea on who they are. This means
writing a Biography of your characters past in order to help shape its future.
This is a very important element for proper RP.
 
First off you must understand that your character is new to the world of Dark
Knights and although were sure you have the potential of being the greatest
Jedi who ever lived, doing so after just leaving the academy is unlikely.
 
General Tips:
 
Read help timeline Although the MUD creates it own Star Wars story, the
timeline is more of a guide for technologies, people etc that would be in
existence while playing this MUD.
 
Know the history and traits of your race. (Search the internet, check
helpfiles)
 
Stats: If you rolled Wisdom 11, then your character shouldnt be know for great
war strategies . But perhaps they would make a good mercenary or pirate.
Keep your stats in mind.
 
Think realistically. If youre 17 years old, youre really just beginning a
bigger story. If you'd like to be a leader, think about perhaps coming from a
rich family. If you're Bounty Hunter, who and what drove you following that
profession.
 
Your bio should reflect some experiences that help shaped your characters
personality, profession choice and fill in some gaps that lead up to your
entrance into Dark Knights MUD. Do some research on the internet while gaining
the first levels of your character so when you start getting the levels to fit
into the world of Dark Knights youll have a solid bio to use during your RP and
enhance the fun for everyone.

BLINDNESS:
syntax:  feel blindness <victim>
 
This power renders the target character blind.
 
GOUGE:
syntax:  gouge
 
This attack can only be used in combat, and will strike at the eyes
of your opponent, causing damage and temporary blindness.
 
 
General:
Certain powers and attacks can render a player blind for anywhere from a
few rounds (gouge) to several hundred rounds (the blind power).  If you
are blinded, you will see only your name on the 'who' list, and will be
unable to see either your inventory or your location.
 
You may either wait out the effect of the blindness, request assistance
over channels, or make your way to a healer such as Kyan in Darkhaven,
who will eventually remove your blindness.

1 CARGO SHIPMENT SHIPPING RESOURCES~
Cargo can be loaded on to mid-sized or larger ships equipped with a docking
bay. It is transfered between planets from where it is plentiful, or un-
needed, to where it is lacking or much sought after. This makes a fairly
lucrative business for some of the galaxies career pilots, and even for some
that are less skilled at it. Use 'Stat' command to check if your ship can
hold cargo. 'Loadcargo' buys cargo and puts it onto your ship from a docking 
pad, 'Unloadcargo' does the opposiite, selling it to the planet you are
currently on. To check the prices, availablility, and production/consumption
of a planet use "imports <planet>"

Available Resources:
Tabanna Gas, a type of gas, approximately the same density as air, that is used
             in the making of laser weapons.
Food,        various types of food shipped between planets.
Electronics, various electronic components and products.
Art,         different types of art that may appeal to a planets population.
Durasteel,   common metal used in making just about everything.
Crystals,    industrial crystals used for different purposes.
Alazhi,      an ingredient in Bacta, the addition of which makes it more potent.

1 CAST FEEL~
Syntax: feel <force power> [target]
 
Before you can use a force power, you have to practice it.  The more you 
practice, the higher chance you have of success.  You also must also
be force sensitive and have enough force energy to use the powers.

The [target] is optional.  Many powers which need targets will use an
appropriate default target, especially during combat.

If the power name is more than one word, then you must quote the power name.
Example: feel 'cure critic' frag.  Quoting is optional for single-word powers.
You can abbreviate the power name.

When you use an offensive power, the victim usually gets a saving throw.
The effect of the power is reduced or eliminated if the victim makes the
saving throw successfully.

CHANGES

  Removed the races of Chadra-fan and quarren, as these are, in our
opinion, the most worthless races. Instead we have added droids and
shistivanans. We have made it so that droids now can not eat, and do not
need to. We have made drastic changes to the levels that various races
get, as well as the max stats. Maximum stats have been increased and skill
levels have been rearranged. Currently, all skills are working. Most of
the leadership skills have been modified, using a different method. Many
new engineering skills have been added, including makeknife, makepike,
makefurniture, and make bowcaster. Knives are a variation on blades, are a
little stronger, but are more limited in their use. Racial skills have
been added, allowing for various avenues of role play.  Further,
occupations is a new class. These skills allow for a method to make an IC
living without blatantly breaking RP doing gun runs, drug sales, or
exploitation of bugs. These skills are to be used in conjunction with your
RP to further your character.  The finger command has been added to show
you player information. You can set your own information using SETSELF. 
We have changed some aesthetics, the way that is displayed, as well as
score, wizlist and level.  Auto questing has been added, and will be fully
implemented shortly. Cargo systems for ships have been added, as well as
bay doors, tractor beams, and self destruct. The command freeships has
been added, and have added fields to radar, allowing for more intricate
space battles. We have removed alot of spam from space battles. Each level
you receive, you gain something, the result different depending on the
class.  There is much more, and we are adding more everyday.

players.  '.' is a synonym for CHAT.

The ASK and ANSWER commands both use the same 'question' channel.
These channels are reserved for immortals.

YELL sends a message to all awake players within your area.

You can use the CHANNELS command to hear, or not hear, any of these channels.

OOC stands for out of character and is the only chennel that should be used

to get a look at its equipment and description, this will often help
indictate how hard a fight might be.  You can CONSIDER <mob> for a one
on one comparison of the mobs hitpoints and level to your own.  You may
also FEEL IDENTIFY <mob> to get more detailed information about the mob
if you have force ability.
 
You may start a fight by using KILL, MURDER, or many powers and skills
available to players.  The easiest way to start a fight is to KILL <mob>.
Currently, you may also MURDER <mob>, but this causes the mob to yell out.
 
You may find yourself in trouble during a fight, and wish to leave, this
can be done by using FLEE or RECALL.  You can flee a fight by typing FLEE.
You may recall from a fight with the power 'word of recall' or by reciting
a recall scroll.  You may also set it up to flee automatically once you go
below a certain number of hitpoints by using WIMPY.  To use your wimpy, type
WIMPY or WIMPY <number of hitpoints>.  Leaving a fight with wimpy, flee, and
recall WILL cost you a loss of experience, with recall causing the greatest
loss.

 - the number of hitpoints recovered or regenerated at each tick if
   resting or sleeping
 
 - the number of additional moves a character receives at level
 
 - improvement or worsening of a character's mental state, thus
   affecting general endurance
 
No class receives constitution as a prime attribute.

1 'CONTAINERS' 'CONTAINER'~
Containers are almost a necessity in the game.  They are used to carry
items, food, and drinks.  They help allow you to sort things, by using two
or more types of containers at once.  Corpses use many of the same commands
as regular containers.

EXAM <container> or LOOK IN <container> allows you to see what it contains.

GET <item> <container> allows you to take one item from a container.
GET ALL <container> allows you to take everything from a container at once.
GET ALL.<item> <container> allows you to take all of a particular item type

PUT <item> <container> puts an item inside a container.
PUT ALL <container> will put as much of your inventory in the container as
possible, until the container is full.
PUT ALL.<item> <container> will put as much of one type of item into the
container as possible, until the container is full.

1 COOK~
This skill is for role-playing your job, like all other occupational
skills.

You must be inside a cafe, restaurant, or bar and not in any type of
outdoor area to properly cook. 
Once you complete cooking a meal you will recieve a small amount of
Occupation experience and a small amount of credits. Moving up the job
chain, finally making a name for oneself. 

The culinary arts are one of the finer arts when dealing with jobs,
requiring the utmost attention to detail, or the flip of a spatula.

1 COUNCIL COUNCILS SENATE SENATOR GOVERNMENT GOVERNMENTS POWER~
There are three levels of government: 1. ORGANIZATIONS: The major player
run superpowers are the New Repubic, The Empire, and The Corperate
Authority. There are also several small organizations and crime families
operating independantly. Type CLANS for a list. 2. regional GOVERNMENTS:
These are small areas that may be controlled and profited from by player
organizations. They may be captured by organizations with the capture
command. Type GOVERNMENTS for a list. 3. The SENATE: The senate was
restored by the New republic shortly after the battle of Endor. It has
since then broken off its direct ties with the New Republic in order to
include the council heads from all worlds including Imperial controlled
worlds. The senate meets monthly at the traditional senate hall on
coruscant. However because of the difficulty that imperials face flying
near coruscant a shuttle has been set up that provides safe transportation
from a nuetral outpost to the Senate hall. The senate hall also has a
series of opinion booths were council heads can comunicate with their
people. These opinion booths are also used for electing new council heads.
Type SENATE for a list of senators.

will be allowed to make use of them. If you wish to obtain one, speak to
Erflink, Greven, or any head builders that might be on. The Base prices for
modifications are listed below, these may (and probably will) be raised
during the rp session with the immortal selling them.

0 DEFEL "AF'EL"~
Defel are an Alien species that appear as large, red-eyed shadows under most 
lighting conditions. This has given rise to their common name:
Wraiths. Under Ultraviolet light, Defels appear as stocky, fur-covered bipeds 
with protruding snouts and long, clawed, triple-jointed fingers.
They stand about 1.3 meters tall, with shoulders as wide as 1.2 meters across. 
This species lives in underground cities on the planet Af'El, where most 
inhabitants make their living through mining and metallurgy. In the galaxy at 
large, Defel often find employment as hired muscle, spies, and assassins due to 
their shadowy forms.

Defel can't wear armor because it would interfere with their natural
invisibility. However the fact that they are nearly impossible to see makes
them very difficult to hit.

-----Playing a Defel-----
Defels almost always avoid light, crowds, and any other situation where they
could be easily seen. They live in the shadows, which usually lends them to
the roles of assassins, smugglers, spies, or other low-lifes. Few defels
venture off their home planet, and those that do are usually outcasts. Very
rarely a defel will be something other than dark natured, though they usually
stay well away from any dealings with the empire or the rebellion.

0 DEVARONIAN~
The males have smooth skin with no hair, and horns on 
their heads. They are docile and not aggressive at all. They take 
great pride in their horns, and groom them regularly. The females 
have calico fur and no horns. They are highly aggressive, and usually 
dominate Devaronian culture. Devaronians are carnivores, and consume 
nearly every bit of food that they ingest. They were one of the first 
races to discover star travel and develop star drives. 

How to play: Males: Non-aggressive, calm beings. Not given to sudden 
bursts of anger, tantrums, etc. Females: Highly aggressive. Dominate 
society over the males of their species in most cases. Both sexes,  
however, are hunters by nature.

1 DEXTERITY DEX~
Dexterity (DEX in your 'score') represents your character's agility, and
it affects (among other things):
 
 - the maximum number of items you can carry at once in your inventory;
   with each additional point of dex you can carry additional items.
 
 - each additional point of dexterity also lowers (improves) your natural
   armor class.
 
 - the number of new moves you receive each time you level, as well as the
   number of moves you regenerate at each tick (when resting to refresh or
   regain movement points).
 
 - success chances with bash and stun, and helps determine whether a thief
   will be able to poison a weapon.
 
Dexterity is also very important for quaffing potions in combat.  High dex
will allow you to quaff without dropping many potions during the heat of
battle, while a poor dexterity will cause you to accidentally drop many
of the valuable vials.
 
Dexterity is the prime attribute of thieves.

1 DIG DIGGING BURY BURYING~
Syntax:  dig
Syntax:  dig  <direction>
Syntax:  bury <item>
 
You can dig and bury items through the use of the dig skill and bury command.
Buried items are not visible to players, even through the use of powers such

Depending on the size and weight of the object, you might need a shovel.
 
* Note:  Deadly players can bury/dig up each other's corpses. *
 
Items buried will not last beyond crash or reboot.  Do not attempt to use
this skill for storage of items you wish to keep.

                     Additional contributions from:

 Michael Curran  - the player title collection and additional locations.
 Bill Wisner     - for being the first to successfully port the game,
                   uncovering several old bugs, uh, inconsistencies,
                   in the process.

         And: Mads Haar and Stephan Dahl for additional locations.

  The Original DIKUMud was Developed at the Department of Computer Science

0 DUINUOGWUIN~
Duinuoqwuins, or Star Dragons, are a sad, noble species with a habit of taking 
up  lost causes. These huge, snakelike multipeds with gossamer wings average 
about ten meters long. Large, reptilian scales cover their bodies, though they 
have floppy, mammallike ears. Each body segment has a pair of legs, though the 
limbs attached to the foward segments have evolved into arms and hands. This 
ancient species comes from a secret, unknown world. They can be encountered on 
all types of worlds and even in deep space, where it seems they need no 
artificial protection. The Star Dragons have a deep-rooted sense of morality 
and honor, and most have at least some sensitivity to the Force. There are even 
tales that tell of an ancient time when Duinuoqwuin served as Jedi Knights.

Because of their enormous size Duinouqwuin cannot wear armor. However they
have excellent hit points and regeneration rate. They also have the unique
ability to fly.

-----Playing a Duinuogwuin-----
Duinuogwiuns are generally a mellow race, taking their time to ponder decisions.
Their thought process works differently than most humanoids, and they often have
a deep, haunted look in their eyes. They base their loose cultural standards on
justice, and will often go a long way out of their way to see it done. This
doesn't always ensure that they are light natured, but most Duin's tend towards
the rebel side of the war.

If you are within 5 levels of another character, you have the ability
to group with that player.  You are not able to group a non-deadly
and a deadly character however (see HELP DEADLY). When you are grouped
with another player, you attack mobs together and share the experience
for each kill.

  *FOLLOW <player> - you will follow that player at which point they group you
                   - to remove yourself from group type: FOLLOW <your name>

  *GROUP <player> - you add that player to your group
                  - typing GROUP alone will list the people in your group
                  - to remove someone from group type: GROUP <player name>

         eat   [object] <container>      (eat directly from a container)
 
Drink instructs your character to drink from a fountain or a drink container
to alleviate thirst.
 
Eat instructs your character to eat an item of food or a magical pill (which
function in a similar fashion as potions); pills do not fill stomach space.
 
When you are hungry or thirsty (you will see messages at each tick that
tell you if you are starving or dying of thirst, and can check your
current state with either 'score' or 'oldscore'), you will not regain
hitpoints, movement points or force back as rapidly as if you were well
fed and hydrated.
 
If you stay hungry or thirsty too long and you are not an Avatar, your
mental state will begin to suffer.  Your combat skills will be affected,
your coordination will suffer and you may begin to either hallucinate or
become depressed.  Eating, drinking and a little rest will solve this
problem after a short period of time.

101 ECONOMY~
Each area will initialize (on bootup of the mud) with a pool of gold based
on the area's range and the wealth of each mob in that area.
 
The shopkeepers and thieves will automatically deposit gold into the economy
if they are carrying more than a certain amount (the higher the level of the
shopkeeper, the greater they will carry before depositing).
 
To allow mobprogs to be created to manipulate area economies, making them
interactive and interdependent, there are two mpcommands:  mpdeposit, and
mpwithdraw (see related helpfiles).  There is also an 'if economy' ifcheck.
 
The aset command can also be used to adjust an area's economy by hand
(example:  aset <area filename> low_economy <amount>, this will give
the specified area a minimum economy at the level you set).
 
Mobs will not repop with more gold than what they were originally created
with, but if the area economy runs low they will begin to repop with less
until the economy is replenished (as they all share the same gold pool).
 
Use foldarea to make changes to an area's economy with aset permenent.

the AC of the item is damaged by one.  If the AC on an item is 5, after it
is damaged more than five times it will be destroyed or scraped.
 
If you wish to preserve the equipment, you must repair it by taking it to
the town blacksmith. (NOTE:  Not all equipment is repairable)  You may also
notice that while fighting a creature which attacks you with acid breath or
another acid attack, your equipment gets "etched and pitted."  When this

0 EWOK ENDOR~
The Curious, furred bipeds native to Endor's forest moon are called Ewoks. 
Standing about one meter tall, the tribal Ewoks have yet to advance beyond 
spears and bows, but their understanding of forest lore and survival skills 
cannot be matched by a more advanced species. These Hunter gatherers live in 
village clusters built high within the moon's giant trees. Easily startled, the 
Ewoks are nonetheless brave, alert, and loyal, and they can be fierce warriors 
when necessary. The Ewok language is liquid and expressive, and most humans and 
other aliens can learn to speak it. Ewoks, conversely can learn Basic, though 
they often mix in many words from their own language. During the day, Ewoks 
come down out of their tree villages to hunt and forage on the forest floor. At 
night, the forest belongs to huge carnivores, and even the youngest Ewoks know 
not to venture out after dark. The Ewoks' mystical beliefs contain many 
references to the Force, though it is never named as such. They are a musical 
species, are overly curious, and are loyal to their tribes and friends.

-----Playing an Ewok-----
Ewok's are a very inquisitve race, always questioning and testing. They only
strayed off of their home planet of Endor after the great battle between the
imperials and rebels above the forrest moon. Because of this, they tend to be
very naieve and easily duped by more street-smart beings. Ewoks tend towards
light natured characters, but find themselves doing many different things for
many different people throughout their lives.

101 EXITMAKING~
The 'redit exit' command is used to create, modify and remove exits in a room.
For more than one exit in the same direction see ADVANCEDEXITS.

The syntax of the 'redit exit' command is as follows:
redit exit <direction> [vnum] [exit-type] [key] [keyword(s)]
direction: one of: n, s, e, w, u, d, ne, nw, se, sw or ?
vnum     : the room number in which the exit leads to.
exit-type: a number detailing the exit -- has a door, open/closed/locked etc.
key      : a number corresponding to a key object which can unlock the door.
keywords : keywords used to refer to the door, (or exit).

If only 'redit exit <direction>' is specified, the exit will be removed.
The 'key' field is optional when specifying keywords.  All other fields are
required previous to the field desired.

Examples:
redit exit n 3001           - Creates an exit north to room 3001
redit exit n 3001 3 gate    - Changes the exit north to have a closed "gate"
redit exit n 3001 3 15 gate - Changes the gate to allow use of a key vnum 15
redit exit n                - Removes the north exit

See EXITTYPES for generating the exit-type value, or EXITNUMBERS for
their numerical counterpart.

101 EXITTYPES~
These are the currently valid exit-types:
      0 - Plain exit
      1 - Door exists         (Required to be closed or locked)
      2 - Door is Closed
      4 - Door is Locked
      8 - Door is Secret      (Trying to go that way won't reveal door)
     32 - Door is Pickproof   (Door can't be picked by power or skill)
     64 - Need to be able to fly to go that way
    128 - Need to be able to climb to go that way
   1024 - Door is Passdoor proof

NOTE: You must ADD the values together to generate an exit-type:
        3 = a closed door
        7 = a closed and locked door
       11 = a closed secret door
       15 = a closed, locked and secret door

-- Use the 'redit exflags' command to change these flags, and to set the
   advanced exit flags, most of which are not shown above.

See EXFLAGS and EXITMAKING.

1 EXPERIENCE LEVEL XP~
Syntax: level
 
Your character advances in power by gaining experience.  Type LEVEL to see
how many experience points you'll need for the next few levels.
 
You gain experience by:
    inflicting damage upon an opponent
    being part of a group that kills an opponent
    succeeding while learning a skill or a power through real world usage
 
You lose experience by:
    fleeing from combat
    recalling out of combat
    being the target of some powers (energy drain, etc.)
    dying
 
The experience you get from a kill depends on several things:  how many 
players are in your group; your level versus the level of the monster;
your alignment versus the monster's alignment and some random variation.
 
Your last 25 kills are recorded.  Each time you kill a creature that has
been one of your last 25 kills you will receive less and less exp for it.
The creature will also learn from its experience with you over time; if
its intelligence is higher than your own it will begin to gain an
advantage over you in combat.

0 FALLEEN~
The Falleen are a race of very intellegent reptillian humanoids. Primitive
by nature, they are weakened in the practice of medicine, and, viewing 
mammals as inferior to their reptillian brothers, they often lack the 
social skills to hold jobs or perform diplomatic missions, so the only 
way they find themselves making a living often involves evading the 
intergalactic law. They are usually born in the water, have clawed fingers
and toes, and can change the color of their scales when angry. 

Playing as a Falleen: Falleens are very intellegent and sensible, but 
few ever get the chance to see that. They spend little time on mammals, 
acting rudely and sometimes with hostility towards them. They do, however,
make excellent bounty hunters, smugglers, and pirates (especially since 
the majority of who they are stealing from is a race they despise). Between
two or more reptiles such as Falleen's, there can be an array of
spectacular 
theories and ideas that can make even the wisest mammal seem inferior.

automatically join the fight.
 
If character is already a member of your group, using 'group <character>'
will remove them from your party.  Removing the character from the group
does not stop them from following you, however.  A character can also
leave your group by using the 'follow self' command, in which case they
will both leave your group and stop following you.
 
'Group' with no argument shows statistics for each character in your group.
 
You may follow lower level characters or characters up to ten levels higher.
You may group only characters within eight levels of your own.

0 GAMORREAN GAMORREANS~
The Gamorrean people are known for their brutish, porcine appearance, 
along with their great strength and minute intelligence.  Green skinned
with pig-like snouts, they are among the Galaxy's best laborors and
mercenaries. They also have impressive stamina, allowing them to with-
stand large assaults and physical trauma.

When Gamorr was discovered, the populace was enslaved.  Those who
escaped this fate quickly traveled offworld to sell their services to
outsiders as guards and mercenaries.  Now, thanks to their superb idiocy,
they have been abandoned as a source of slave labor.

-----Playing a Gamorrean-----
Gamorreans are, as a race, slow and brutish, evolving from creatures
similar to pigs, they barely have the intelligence to have made fire and
learned to use tools, but slowly over the centuries contact with outside
races has forced some basic knowledge of the workings of mechanics and
engineering into their head. They are strong, and they know it, and they
dont know much else, so it makes them dangerous. They are capable of
learning and speaking other languages, but often mix in grunts and
squeels out of habbit.

0 GIVIN~
The Givin, hailing from the planet Yag'Dhul, have a rather disturbing
appearance, as they resemble an animated skeleton. They can survive 
for short times in hard vacuum, but they have to gorge before they can.
This capacity was evolved because the moon system of their planet causes
parts of their planet to become airless temporarily. They've also 
evolved a natural barometer to help them predict when the vacuum will 
hit.

How to play: During the Clone Wars, the Givin sided with the 
Seperatists. They are excellent engineers, and provided their superb 
craft to the dissident faction of the Republic. They respect Verpine 
and Duro for their shipbuilding skills, but they cannot bring 
themselves to agree with the Mol Calamari methods of starship construction.
Mathematics saved the Givin, and became the central part of their 
culture, and mathematicians act as high priests for the Givin, predicting 
when the vacuum will uncover parts of their planet.

nothing to do with politics. Their society exists in peaceful 
anarchy. They resisted entry into the Old Republic, and had

1 GRAB~
&RSyntax: &Ggrab &C<&cvictim&C>&w
 
If you do this, your character will attempt to physically restrain the 
victim. This will also cause the victim to follow your character. 
While restrained, your victim can only struggle to get free. There 
are other commands which work, such as say, or emote, or quit. As 
well as that, any command that is OOC (IE score, or usage of the OOC 
channel) can still be performed. 

Note: If you bind someone, GRAB is usefull for moving them around.

Syntax: gtell <message>  or  ; <message>
Syntax: say   <message>
Syntax: tell  <character> <message>
Syntax: otell  <character> <message>
Syntax: oreply <message> 
 
All of these commands send messages to other players.  GTELL sends a message to
all of the characters in your group, wherever they are, even if they are
sleeping or stunned or dying.  ';' is a synonym for GTELL.
 
SAY sends a message to all awake players in your room.  The single quote '''
is a synonym for SAY.
 
TELL sends a message to one awake player anywhere in the world.
 
REPLY sends a message to the last player who sent you a TELL.  REPLY will work
even if you can't see the player, and without revealing their identity.  This
is handy for talking to invisible or switched immortal players.

OSAY, OTELL and OREPLY work the same way as SAY, TELL and OTELL, but are for
out of character informantion.

will be selected if you do not specify a page.
 
NOTE - Always, when creating a new help entry, type Help <new entry name>
       prior to creating your entry. A pre-existing help file associated
       with that keyword may already exist.
&Y
Colors &wcan now be added to help files using the same command set that changes
a player prompt.  &bMultiple &Ycolor &wcombinations can be set on a given line
including ^bbackground^x colors.  However, there are a couple of quirks to take
note of:
&Y
    1) If the first line of your help file containers a color code and you are
       experiencing a display problem with the file, use a . to begin the file.
    2) Color changes should be separated by at least one character.  Example:
       '&&Y.^^r' will work, '&&Y^^r' may cause problems.

101 HELL UNHELL~
Syntax: hell <character> <number> <hours or days>
Syntax: unhell <character>
 
The hell command sends a character to hell for a given period of time.  It
automatically releases the character when their time has been served.  Upon
being helled, the character receives the message, "The immortals are not 
pleased with your actions.  You shall remain in hell for <time period>."
 
Hell takes arguments of either hours or days.  To hell someone for 3 hours,
"hell <character> 3 hours."  To hell someone for three days, "hell <character>
3 days".  Hell will default to hours if hours or days is not specified.

To release a player from hell early, simply "unhell <character>".

If you successfully SNEAK, you can move from place to place without being
noticed by other characters.
 
In order to HIDE or SNEAK successfully, you must practice the appropriate

This command will give you a listing of available help files. The list
is in alphabetical order based on the first triggering keyword. While
this command was initially designed as a maintenance tool to help us
track help files, it is also available to players so that they can
capture a listing of the help files available to them. 
 
Note - You may only view help files that are coded for viewing by your
       level or lower.
 
Note - The list of help files is quite extensive, and the command does
       not as yet have a way to filter/shorten the list. Screen capture
       is, at present, your only recourse.

0 HO'DIN~
A humanoid race with snakelike appendages. Movements of these 
appendages punctuate their language. They are native to the 
planet Moltok. They have the ability to cure wounds and illnesses 
with natural methods, instead of technology. They can grow to 
be up to three meters tall. The hands have four fingers with 
webbing between them. They went through the final stages of the 
evolution process only three hundred years before the Galactic 
Civil War, making them a new addition to the galaxy. They live 
for about 120 years. 

How to play: HoDins worship nature, much like Ithorians.  
Their children are taught about the dangers of technology and  
progress, the things that led to the "Great Rape of the Land".

101 HOLYLIGHT INVIS IMMFLY PASSDOOR~
Syntax: holylight
Syntax: invis
Syntax: immfly
Syntax: passdoor

HOLYLIGHT is a toggle that allows you to see (almost) every character and
mobile in the game.  With holy light, you can see what's in the game more
easily.  Without holy light, you can see what mortal players see.

INVIS is a toggle which makes you completely invisible to all player characters
of lower level than you, and to all mobiles.

When an immortal is INVIS, they will have a flag on the who list which 
indicates their level of invisibility, such as (51) for INVIS 51.  A 
similar flag will also appear when you 'LOOK' in a room - this flag will 
say (Invis 51).

HOLYLIGHT will not allow you to see immortal INVIS characters who are
higher level than you.
 
IMMFLY will allow immortals to make them selves fly, useful when building
rooms with no floors. 
 
PASSDOOR will set the immortal with the passdoor flag, allowing them to
walk through closed and locked doors.

You must be in any inside hotel area and not in any type of outdoor area to

of credits. 

Much like an interior cleaner, except much more specified and proud of

Note:  If you have instances of multiple help files with the same keyname,
       using Hset Remove without a level designation will remove the one with
       the lowest level of access. ie:
 
       Help file XYZZY at level 57, and help file 'SAVE XYZZY' at level 58.
       Typing 'HSET REMOVE XYZZY' will remove the level 57 XYZZY.
       Typing 'HSET REMOVE 58.XYZZY' will remove the level 58 'SAVE XYZZY'.
 
       Hedit is used to edit help files in a normal buffer.

0 HUMAN HUMANS~
Humans are the most numerous and least unusual of the races.  They possess 
no special abilities or bonuses, but also have no penalties.  Because of
this, Humans are extremely adaptable and are able to assume a variety of
classes and roles.
 
Humans are bipedal beings, boasting two arms, two legs and a roundish head.
Amazingly, Humans have a strange tendency to look different from each the
other; almost none look exactly alike.



-----Playing a Human-----
Humans have no usual tendancies, no racial traits, no easy way to be told how
to role play. Humans are humans, they do all kinds of strange things that no
one can explain. However, we ask that you choose a type of personality, and
some basic character traits, and play your character accordingly.

0 HUTT HUTTS~
An obese race, the Hutts are among the Galaxy's most despicable low-lifes. 
They live on their adopted homeworld of Nal Hutta, having completely
strip-mined their original home.  Due to their great size, they lack any
appreciable dexterity, however such size does lend itself to some added
protection. In addition, many have keen minds and a good deal of common
sense, probably due to the fact that they are constantly trying to kill
one another. Their ability to coerce, convince, cajole, and otherwise make
others follow them is a thing of legend. Hutts are often found to be the
center of large crime rings or heading other activities with high profits.
 
Centering their entire lives around the aquisition of power and wealth, 
there is little art, of any type, associated with them.  Some do, however,
keep collections for mere boasting value.

-----Playing a Hutt-----
Hutts love to eat, they are extremely gluttonous, and this attibute spills
over into every aspect of their lives. They are gluttonous in everything they
do. When they speak, it is deep and sloppy, when they move, it is slowly and
lazily, when it isn't with the aid of a hover-sled. Their entire manner is
based upon the easy aquisition of money and the "finer" things in life. They
tend towards evil characters, but they generally stay away from either side
of the civil war, prefering to stay neutral and play both sides off for profit.

as well as a bit more dangerous. If you get a Jump warning
odds are you will collide with something when you jump into

0 IC OOC "IN CHARACTER" " OUT OF CHARACTER"~
&C

IC - In character - Means that you're not chatting with your friends about
friday nights plans, or what to wear to the mall, it means what your MUD
CHARACTER is saying. Ignorance is  no excuse for misusing channels, if you
mean to jokingly tell someone OOC you're going to kill them but do it IC
they have every right to defend themselves and attack you if they feel
threatened. You can use the ask and answer, as well as tell channels (if
you don't understand  them there's a reason someone teaches languages)
if;you want to talk OOC or just go to a hotel, it's not that difficult and
it's cheaper then using IC and clears up any confusion and lessens whining
because someone was killed because they "accidentally said the wrong
thing on the wrong channel".
&Y
OOC - Out of Character - Means you're talking about issues not
game related like a bug or have another mud-based question, this
does not mean you go "Hey Jim I need food pick me up" or "Hey 
So and So just killed me I'm gonna get you!" however there are a 
constantly growing number of help files and most of your basic 
questions should be there for answering, but yes there are times
here there are questions only an imm or a fellow player can answer.
However Excessive abuse of OOC will result in possibly being silenced.

1 IMPLANT~

This will install an implant into a specific person. You need a toolkit,
a needle and thread, and an implant. The implant will be put in, but there
is a risk that something might go wrong in the operation. The patient
could suffer injuries, and the implant may not work as well as it is
supposed to. This last factor is also partly dependant on the quality of
the implant.
  
To see what implants you have currently have, and how they affect you, use
the equipment command. There are 7 kinds of implants: one to affect each
statistic, and one that help reduce the need for food/thrist, but only
reduces it. To see what implants you have currently have, and how they

0 INSTALLATIONS~
Installations are a set of player built rooms. There are different kinds of
installations, and each kind performs a seperate purpose. For example, an
Ion Cannon installation will fire ion cannon bursts at clan enemy ships
around the installations planet. A ship yard allows people to build ships
inside the ship yard, as well as creates a landing pad for the clan.   To
create installations, you must use the skill 'makeinstallation'. From
there you can use the command addroom to build various types of rooms into
your installation. Please note, that when building your facility, it will
not be of any use unless you design the entirety of it. All installations
have set sizes, and they must be completed to be effective. Whit this,
there is a special room called the "main room".  This differs from using
addroom on ships, because this room can and must only be added as the last
room of the installation.  Also new for installations is the skill 
"addpersonel". This will create a mob of different types, and will install
resets for that mob, so that it will respawn after a crash or copyover.  

For more infomation, see: Help makeinstallation, help addpersonel, help
addroom

101 INSTAROOM INSTAZONE~
Syntax:  instaroom
 
Functions the same as instazone, but is room-based instead of area-based.
 
Syntax:  instazone [nodoors]
 
This command lets your instantly create a whole set of resets for your area
based on all the mobiles and objects contained within your area.
All you have to do is place each mob in its proper room, wearing what it
should be wearing, carrying what it should be carrying, and objects in their
proper places, or in their proper containers, and doors in their proper
states, (open, closed, locked).  The instazone command will clear out your
current resets (if any), and create new ones for you.
You may optionally specify "nodoors" so that door resets will not be
created.
 
NOTE:  This command will wipe out any existing resets!  Do not use this
command after you have added your own resets with 'reset add'.
The recommended procedure is to use instazone, then use the 'reset' command
to add any special resets, and NOT use instazone again.
 
See RESET and RESETCMDS.

1 INTELLIGENCE INT~
Intelligence (INT in your 'score') represents your character's mental
capacity.  Among other things, it affects:
 
 - heavily influences the amount of force a character gains at level
 
 - affects the amount of force regenerated or recovered at each tick
   if a character is resting or sleeping
 
 - the rate at which a character learns a new skill or power
 
 - the percentage rate at which a character practices a new language
 
Intelligence is an important factor in learning between combatants.  If
a character fights a creature several times, the more intelligent of the
two opponents will gain an advantage over time...
 
Intelligence is the prime attribute of the mage.

0 ITHORIAN~
They have two throats, but only one head, thus making them very hard to 
understand. The eyes are on opposites sides of the hammer-shaped part of 
the ladle-shaped head. Their mouths are hidden below the sloped part of 
the head. They also have wide, flattened feet to help them balance. 

How to play: Ithorians are peaceful creatures, most of them totally  
incapable of committing any violent action. They live in their great 
herdships that float above Ithor, and allow no one to set foot on 
their sacred planet. They are also very wise and intelligent beings.

0 JAWA JAWAS~
Small, foul smelling creatures, Jawas live almost exclusively on Tatooine.
Their personal habits and way of life make them fairly repulsive to many
other races.  Their size does give them an edge on dexterity, and the
constant work they do on machinery gives them a similar edge in intelligence.
 
While over 99% of all Jawas live on Tatooine, some have been seen elsewhere.
The lower levels of Coruscant are rumored to harbor some, as well as a most
unlikely locale, Smuggler's Run.

-----Playing a Jawa-----
Jawas deal almost exclusively with themselves, they avoid other races except
as a means of making money. Most jawas live simply on subsistance, their daily
routine being enough to give them purpose in life. On Tatooine, they simply
search for machines, parts, droids, or anything else mechanical, fix it up,
and sell it for enough money to continue their search. Jawas that have strayed
elsewhere in the galaxy tend to do the same thing, which makes jawa-made
armor and weapons some of the cheapest in the galaxy, if not the best made.

1 JEDIS "JEDI KNIGHTS" JEDI FORCE~
.      The Force is very rare in the Star Wars Universe,  so to keep in
reality, we have set it up so only 1 in around 100 characters acctually has
the Force.  If  you are Force capable , you will find out by training  the
meditate skill at luck and after much practice you may become tunned to the
force.

---------------------------------------------------

&RNOTE: Force rolling is 1 in every 100 characters for a REASON
&Y
Harrassing immortals to give you force ability is NOT advised, and spam
creating characters
until you get force capability is HARSHLY frowned upon.
&g
---------------------------------------------------

Woven
into and intertwined with everything - from the smallest molecule to the
largest star - is the Force. The Force is an essential part of nature - like
energy or matter. It is a field of energy that spans the universe. It
surrounds and penetrates all things. This energy field is made up of chlorian
"particles" - subatomic, high energy, fluctuations in the quantum state of the
space-time continuum. Chlorian particles exist throughout the universe as
"background" radiation. Even in the deepest void of space, one can find
chlorian particles. Due to the unique nature of chlorian particles, they
affect both matter and energy. Chlorian particles are not true particles, but
do possess mass. Chlorians also exhibit the wave motion properties of
electromagnetic radiation. Hence, they travel through most matter at light
speed, while still interacting with matter on an atomic level.   Every
sentient being, with a few exceptions, have a symbiotic relationship with
microscopic creatures called midichlorians. Since these midichlorians exist in
a state of interspatial flux, outside of normal space-time, they cannot be
detected by most conventional technologies. We provide them with a place to
live and a way to nurture themselves, and they "let us in" on the Force.
Midichlorians generate a specific and unique energy. In a similar fashion to
the way mass distorts the space-time continuum to bend the fabric of reality
and produce gravity, the energy generated by midichlorians distorts the
universal chlorian field. The presence of the midichlorian energy causes an
increase in density in the chlorian field i.e. the Force itself.   Some
sentient beings are able to exert a certain amount of control over chlorian
particles. The process occurs during the interaction between midichlorian
energy and chlorian particles. In such interactions, the midichlorian energy
can alter the wavelength and frequency of chlorian wave properties.
Midichlorian energy can also alter the density, quantum oscillation, phase and
other properties of chlorian particles. By influencing chlorian particles,
they can be directed, used to manipulate energy, matter, spatial anomalies and
other phenomena. Now, the more midichlorians one has, the stronger their
connection to the Force. However, it is rare for anyone to be able to
manipulate the Force with less than 7,000 midichlorians per cell.   The Force,
itself, is defined in many different ways. A two ways are the Living Force and
the Unifying Force. The Living Force represents all living things while the
Unifying Force is everything that lives in the past and future. The Unifying
Force is the collective pool of all the energy in the universe. This means it
also includes non- living things as even non-living things have matter and
matter and energy are interchangable. The Living Force is the collective pool
of the energy of living things. It encompasses living things and therefore
also sentience.   The light and dark sides of the Force relates to the nature
of most sentient beings and of all creatures who have free will. It represents
the dark and light sides to us as living creatures, and our ability to control
those sides of "good" and "evil". The light represents the good in all, and
the dark represents the evil.

0 KEL DOR "KEL DOR"~
Native to the oxygen-free planet Dorin, Kel Dor's are rarely found anywhere
else in the galaxy. These humanoid creatures have an orange tinted skin
and extrasensory organs protruding from their head. When in an oxygen rich
environment, their psysiology demands that they wear protective goggles
and an antiox mask. Kel Dor's are naturally wise, making them expert
diplomats and leaders, however their necessity to remain on their
homeworld would dull their cunning. 
 
Playing as a Kel Dor  
Kel Dor's have a reputation for having a clear distinction  
between right and wrong, and can often make rash decisions   
without too much contemplating. This further sharpens their  
leadership abilities. Although not much for words, Kel Dor's 
are very deep-minded and wise, and are rarely seen raining  
down upon law and order. However, as in all cases, there is  
the rare sight of a renegade Kel Dor, especially if they  
choose to use their wisdom and leadership to offset the  
contemporary peace.

&gLayers are currently available on the following wear locations:
 
&GAbout, Arms, Body, Feet, Hands, Legs, Waist.
 
&gLayers are set with a numeric value, or combination of values.  The lower
the value, the lower the layer, or thinner the item of clothing/armor is.
 
Valid numeric values are:
 
&G0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128.
 
&gOr any combination of the above. A value of zero means no other items came
be layered with this item. Items of clothing can be layered over one another
as long as their layer values do not overlap. ie, if leather armor were set
to a value of 56 (8, 16, and 32), it could not layer with, say, a set of
heavy chain that is set to a value of 96 (32 and 64), as they overlap on the
layer value of 32.

The stock SWR training system has been disabled for new characters. The
creation process is to be used to modify your characters statistics in a

was in place, the immortals can bestow the train command
 
The reason for this: It is the opinion of the immortals that all characters
should not be able to be exactly the same. If the stock training system is

101 LOG SNOOP~
Syntax:  log   <character>
Syntax:  log   all
Syntax:  snoop <character>
 
LOG <character> causes all of a character's commands to be logged into the
server's log file and to the log channel.  Like FREEZE, it is a permanent
character toggle that persists across reboots until removed.
 
Certain commands (such as password) are protected against LOG.  Conversely,
certain commands (especially immortal commands) are always logged.
 
LOG ALL logs all character and mob commands and actions to the server's log
file, but does not send the output to the log channel.  It is a server-wide
toggle; it does not persist across reboots.
 
SNOOP shows you a copy of all the input and output going to a character.  The
character must have an open channel.  You may snoop more than one character
at a time.  The input from the player will be displayed with a header of the
players  name and a percentage sign (i.e. Mudder%)
 
SNOOP yourself to cancel all outstanding snoops.

1 MODIFYSHIP~
syntax: modifyship <ship> <field to increase> <field to decrease> 

This skill allows an engineer to customize a ships attributes. It can be
done to both normal and player built ships. Each stat that can be modified
falls into one category: 

speed manuever hyperspeed cargo battalions 
lasers ions missiles rockets torpedos 
tractors chaff shields hull energy
stealth cloak interdictor 

To change a specific stat, you must also decrease a stat in the same
category. For example, to increase speed, you must also decrease either
your manueverability, your hyperspeed, your cargo holds, or your battalion
capacities. 

When installing a stealth, interdictor, or cloak system, you can remove any
component to be replaced.

0 MON CALAMARI CALAMARIS "MON CALAMARI" "MON CALAMARIAN"~
The Mon Calamari are a race of shore-dwelling bipeds.  Living on a planet
almost totally covered with oceans, they have developed a symbiotic
relationship with the water-dwelling Quarren.  These inhabitants of the sea
mine ore from the ocean's floor and the Mon Calamari design practical uses
for it.  While they are not the most agile or tough race, their long
fight against the Empire has taught them many survival skills.
 
When the Empire came to Mon Calamari, it decimated the population and their
proliferate floating cities.  After months of fighting, the Imperial force
was repelled and the first collective action of the planet was to seek entry
into the Alliance.  The Mon Calamari also provided a great asset to the 
Alliance during the war, converting their numerous Pleasure Cruisers into 
machines of war, bringing much needed capital ships to the Aliiance's forces.

-----Playing a Mon Calamari-----
Mon Calamarians, though originally peacefull, have become a warlike race.
Though they are not the greatest warriors, they excel at leading armies,
flying ships, and generally doing most of the support work that an army
needs. They almost exclusively support the rebellion, but some are dark
natured. They are one of the few planets that sucessfully repulsed imperial
forces during the rebellion, and one of the few races that openly supported
the rebels. They continue to do so in many ways, and most of their race that
leaves Mon Calamari, their home planet, does so to join the republic.

0 MOUNT DISMOUNT~
Syntax: mount <mob>
Syntax: dismount

Mount is a skill, which allows you to mount certain mobs.  Being mounted 
on a mob cuts down on movement points that are used whenever you move.
 
New water sectors allow a person mounted to traverse them without damage
from drowning.  If you are in an area where your movement points begin
to drop suddenly and/or you begin to lose hps <hitpoints> quickly, you
should try to mount immediately.

down, northeast, southeast, southwest, and northwest.  You may also move
in these directions by the use of n, e, s, w, u, d, ne, se, sw, and nw.
 
If you need to pass through a door, at times they require being unlocked
and opened. To unlock a door, you type UNLOCK <direction or door name>.
To open a door, you type OPEN <direction or door name>.
 
At times, you may run out of movement points or require healing.  To allow
for faster recovery, you may SIT, REST, or SLEEP.  When are finished with
your recovery, and wish to continue adventuring, type WAKE or STAND.

0 MUDDING~
Introduction to Mudding:

What is MUD?
M - Multi
U - User
D - Dungeon

Ok, Multi User, I understand, but dungeon?
Like in many DND games, the world is 
built out of rooms, you navigate the rooms
with compass directions, now in the world
of mudding things got much better than that,
there are interactable items, killeable
and talkable NPCs (non-player charecters)

So, what's do I get?
The idea of having text instead of graphics...
1. Better performance - it's easier for the computer
2. Good language practice - especialy for non-english speakers
3. Freelance - do what you want, go where you want, kill who you want
4. RP - It's hard to role play in a graphic world (3D shooter? come on!)
5. Better Graphics - Imagination ;)
6. More than kill-em-ups - Clan management,
   sophisticated puzzles, multiple classes,
   IC skills, etc...
7. It's online with many players around
8. You might want to be an Immortal once
9. Lots of fun ;)

Now, if you need more help, read the assistant ('help assistant')
Also, you might want to go through the techincal help ('help technical')

1 NAMES~
.
The name of your character is very important.  As we are trying
to keep this a Role Play Mud please pick reasonable names.
Names of well known star wars characters are frownd upon
and names with profanity or just plain stupid will be denied.
 
i.e. Luke, Vader, Han are well known names.
i.e  Fish Head, Supermanguy, are just plain stupid.

1 NEW NEWBIE START BEGIN~
Welcome to Star Wars:Dark Warriors

Unfortunately alot of the help files aren't done yet... If you get
stuck on anything use the newbie channel and hopefully someone will
be able to help you :)
 
There are several newbie-friendly areas around our mud, including the
training facilities and employment oporotunities buildings on both
Coruscant and Byss.

There are detailed help files available for each race, type help (race
name.) Also, if you are just starting I suggest reading the rules by
typing help rules. Dark Warriors is a RP heavy mud, it is enforced and
rewarded by the immortals. If you role play well, more oporotunities
will be made available for you in the mudding universe.

0 NOGHRI~
The Noghri are a race of great hunters and warriors.  Incredible agility
lend them a large advantage in combat.  For the most part, Noghri are
not technologically advanced, they lack any sort of "street smarts," as
almost none of them have ever gone offworld, and those that do only do so
as body guards and similar occupations.  Their small size also limits their
constition, and thus succumb to wounds more quickly than humans. They have
no hair, and their skin is a dull gray, it gets darker and darker as they
age, and females tend to have slightly browner skin than males. Their average
hight is about four feet.
 
The Noghri live on the fourth planet in their system, the only one of seven
capable of supporting life.  Honoghr is, for the most part, a barren world.
Years ago, during the Clone Wars, a large starship crashed into the planet,
causing massive destruction and posoining much of the planet with coolant
fluids. Since, the Noghri have been extremely dependant on the Empire or
the New Republic for food.

-----Playing a Nogrhi-----
Nogrhi's are very similar to Wookiee's in a lot of ways, and it causes their
races to get along well. Their evolution as hunters, despite their small and
slight body shapes, causes them to have a rigid honor system, to the point of
ritual suicide or asking others to kill them for misdeeds. They are extremely
loyal, and extremely fierce, and have little patience for races that cannot
match them in these traits.

for some mobs to die and then suddenly be back alive again ( the ones

dies... It will still give experience but won't leave a corpse lying
around.

NOTE LIST lists notes which you can read.  NOTE READ reads one or all notes.
By specifying a number after NOTE LIST, you will list all notes including
and after that number.

NOTE SUBJECT sets the subject line of a new note.  NOTE TO sets the list of
recipients.  The recipient ALL means all players, and the recipient IMMORTAL
means all immortals.

NOTE WRITE puts you into edit mode, where you can easily enter your note
with use of some simple editor commands:
            /? - help    /s - save    /l - list    /c - clear

NOTE SHOW shows your note in progress; NOTE CLEAR starts over.

NOTE POST posts your note for reading.  Posting is not automatic.

NOTE REMOVE removes the entire note if you are the sender, or just removes you
from the to-list if you are a recipient.

NOTE TAKE takes the note as in NOTE REMOVE, as well as physically taking 
it in your inventory.

Notes now require a blank message disk to record :)

101 OSET~
Syntax:  oset [object]    <field> <value>
         oset object on
 
If the copy of the object you are currently modifying has the PROTOTYPE flag,
your modifications will also modify the index of that object, which all other
instances of the object are based on.  In the future, every copy of that obj
will reflect your modifications.
 
Also be aware that modifications to the object affect list (everything that
is listed after 'object values') will affect _every_ copy of that object in
the game, including old copies (even if they are not online).  Thus if you
change a prototype-flagged copy of a sword to +4 damroll, every copy of that
vnum ever made will reflect that change.  If you add a 'magic' flag to that
sword, however, only copies made after the change will be affected.
 
If the copy of the object you are modifying does NOT have the PROTOTYPE flag,
your modifications will affect only that copy.
 
OSET ON will lock you onto a particular object.  Once locked on, all commands
commands will imply 'oset [object]'.  Hitting enter while in OSET ON gives
you an ostat of the object you are working on.  To get out of OSET ON, simply
type the word DONE. Example:
 
        oset staff on
        long A long gnarled staff of burnished oak lies here.
        type staff
        done

1 QUARREN~
Quarren is a species named for the aliens who are commonly called Squid Heads 
by the galaxies general populace. These amphibious beings share the world of 
Calamari with the Mon Calamari race, though the Quarren prefer the depths of 
the floating cities to the upper reaches the Mon Cals call home. The Quarren 
are more practical and conservative than their idealistic world-mates. Whereas 
the Mon Calamari have adopted the Basic as their language of choice, the 
Quarren have kept their oceanic tounge. The Quarren are sea dwellers, able to 
live out of the water, but preferring the security of the ocean depths, These 
pragmatic people are unwilling to trust new ideas. They do not dream of 
brighter tomorrows like the Mon Cals, but instead hold fast to the reality of 
yesterdays. While they profess that the two races should remain in the sea, 
they have followed the Mon Cals into their floating cities and out among the 
stars. They have become dependant on the Calamarians, and this dependancy has 
led to resentment and outright hatred. Rumors persist that it was a small 
number of Quarren who helped the Empire originally invade the planet. In the 
face of invading forces, Quarren cooperated with the Mon Calamari to repel the 
Imperials. But since that day, many Quarren have fled the planet to seek a life 
elsewhere in the galaxy. They seem to have purposely remained apart from both 
the Alliance and The Empire, preferring to find a place on the fringes of 
society. Quarren can often be found working with pirates, slavers, crime lords, 
smugglers, and other unsavory sorts.

101 RASSIGN MASSIGN OASSIGN~
Syntax:  rassign <character> <begin vnum range> <end vnum range>
 
These commands allow you to assign a range of vnums to an immortal for

before assigning a range to ensure that there will be no vnum conflicts.
You can also use the 'vnums' command for a complete list of currently
allocated ranges, and the 'newzones' command for a complete list of
prototype vnum ranges.
 
Warning:  *Never* assign any vnums to a character who has another vnum
range assigned to them via 'aassign'.  Simply be sure to have the
character type 'aassign none' before assigning vnums to them.
 
Example:  massign Joseph 9000 9099
 
This will assign the vnum range from 9000 to 9099 for rooms to Joseph.
It is best to keep an areas object, room and mob range the same.
 
Be sure to always use 'checkvnums' to ensure the vnums you are going to
assign are clear.

105 RENUMBER~
&YSyntax: renumber <area filename> <new vnum base> [flags]
Flags: fillgaps verbose
&pExample: renumber haon.are 6100 fillgaps verbose&w

The renumber command renumbers an entire area to a new vnum base. All rooms,
objects and mobs will be renumbered, and all references to them will be fixed 
(changed to reflect the new vnum for each object/mob/room). These references 
include: resets, exits, shops, repair shops, and the objvals of some objects 
(containers and levers). 

Unless the "&pfillgaps&w" flag is supplied, the command doesn't fill vnum gaps. 
If you just want to fill the gaps in the area instead of changing the vnum 
base, simply supply the same vnum base (duh!). 

If the "&pverbose&w" flag is not supplied the command will simply report 
the actions. If it's supplied, it will also list all the vnum changes, and
report details on all the reference fixes.

The command will only modify references inside the area, except for two-way
exits leading into the area, wich will be listed if the "&wverbose&p" flag is
supplied (so that you know that you also have to save those areas). 

Mobprogs can also contain references to vnums, but since prog parsing is
far beyond this command, all it does is perform simple string searches and 
warn you if it finds any (possible) references, and it only does this if
the "verbose" flag is supplied. This search is performed only in the progs
inside this area, not in every mudprog in the game.

In conclusion, &Gall references are modified by the command except&w:
	&p* &Gresets in other areas for things being renumbered
	&p* &Greferences to these vnums in mobprogs in other areas
	&p* &Gone-way entrances to the area

A prototype area can only be moved inside its vnum range, never out of it.
The vnum ranges for proto areas are not touched; the ones for normal areas
are changed to reflect the renumbering. Proto builders can only move their
own area.

Finaly, please bare in mind that there's no way to change hard-coded 
vnums except by changing code. So you'd be advised to &rcheck the
code&w if you ever decide to renumber any of these areas: &rlimbo.are,
newdark.are, newacad.are&w.

However, you are more vulnerable to attack, and if you SLEEP,
you won't hear many things happen.

Use STAND or WAKE to come back to a standing position.  You can
also WAKE other sleeping characters.

0 RODIAN RODIANS RODIA~
Rodians are among the Galaxy's best bounty hunters.  The history of Rodia
is peppered with wars and fueds, many of which are long and bloody.
Trained to fight from birth, they are amazingly agile and intelligent.
Though they almost never go into the scientific fields, their hand-to-hand
combat tactics are some of the best in the Galaxy.
 
For a long time before external contact was made, the Rodian people fought
and killed their own people.  When outside contact was established, they
quickly spread far and wide, seeking work as mercenaries, combat teachers,
assassins, body guards, and especially bounty hunters.  Rodain culture is
divided into different families.  Even now, families sometimes wage long
wars against each other, rather than moving against the outside war.

-----Playing a Rodian-----
Rodians are bred into a family-based culture, and as such, when they leave
Rodia and explore the galaxy, they stay loyal to their families, and often
end up in gangs, cults, or other family-related groups. They are not always
follwers however, the more intelligent of them often begining such
organizations. Rodians are very manipulative and decieving, their loyalty
is always in question to others, but when they decide to be loyal to
something it is for life.

1 ROLEPLAY~
&P&BR&woleplay:

The idea behind Roleplay is to develop a story line, one that involves
several individuals. Writing a bio is a good way to further Roleplay, as
it establishes a past for your character. Roleplay is rewarded, by
Roleplay points. The more you act on what your character would do, the
more story line your character is involved in. Having Role play points
give access to further extents of the mud, which will become evident
if/when your Role play points qualify you. Another part of roleplay is it
is a way to avoid losing your character. Instead of killing the other
person you might roleplay with him, and after whatever exchange you
mutally deem is acceptable you will both survive, an action which your
former adversary may reciprocate. "Do unto others" as the saying goes.

1 RPP "RP POINTS" RP "ROLE PLAY"~
Roleplay points are a method of positively reinforcing your involvement in
roleplay. Your actions are under the scrutiny of some, and good roleplay
will be rewarded, by immortals, for sessions or  or periods that are
deemed worthy. They are not spent, and asking for them will not be met
with any kind words. 4 Role playing points(rpps) are needed if you wish to
join a clan. If you are involved in a role playing event(can be a
simple meeting, or a negotiation for contracts, the skies the limit) then
you can log it(as simple as copy/pasting into a text file) and e-mail it
to &Rdw-rplogs@lists.halkeye.net&g for judgement. If you are rewarded, your total
rpp count will increase. However, you CAN lose points and even go into the
negative.  NOTE: It is a good idea to remove any non-rp messages (ooc
messages, any actions not part of the rp, those) as it makes it easier for
the reader to read it. 

&RWays to gain RP points: 
 
&w- Make sure you have a good description, and bio.
    - 5 lines for the description; a good paragraph for the bio
- A good roleplaying session also can earn RP points. You can send in logs at
the previously stated email. Or Otell the RP/PR Imm that is currently
available, and ask them if they could watch.

1 RULES~
Welcome to Star Wars: Dark Warriors

This is a mud that enforces and rewards role playing. The way we figure
it, whats the point of a mud except to get into another persons mind.
Anyway, the rules are as follows:
 

&B1&z)  &BB&zUGS -&w        If you find a bug. Mudmail Erflink or Greven or 
                  e-mail us. darkwarsmud@hotmail.com
                  Also, you can use "bug <desribe the bug>"
                  We will do our best to fix it.

&B2&z)  &BA&zDVERTISING- &w Dont advertise your mud on here,
                  We didn't advertise on yours did we?

&B3&z)  &BM&zULTIPLAYING -&wYou are allowed to have as many characters as you wish,
                  with certain limitations of course.
                   - They cannot be online at the same time (this includes
                     link dead)
                   - They cannot interact with one another through other
                     players, dropped items, etc.
                   - You role play them properly. Your multiple chars
                     aren't simply vendette killers, backup bankers, free
                     engineers, etc. They are a seperate character, with
                     a developed personality and seperate traits.&R
&B4&z)  &BN&zEWBIES -&w     Be nice to newbies, dont kill someone for something even if
                  it is legitimate, if they are new. Explain to them what they
                  did ooc, and why ic it would be reason for them to die, try
                  and teach newbies how to play well, this will be rewarded.

&B5&z)  &BI&zMMORTALS - &w  Dont be disrespectfull to immortals, if you have a complaint,
                  mudmail or e-mail it to us, all the imms are trying their
                  best, give us some slack.

&B6&z)  &BT&zRIGGERS - &w   Triggers, Macros, Aliases, etc. are legal. The only
                  stipulation is that while using them, you must be able to respond 
                  in a reasonable ammount of time (our judgement, not yours.) 
                  It means you can't go idle, afk, etc. while using triggers.

&B7&z)  &BT&zITLES - &w     Your title must be visible to all, this means no black.

&B8&z)  &BR&zOLE PLAYING -&wRole Playing is expected, enforced, and rewarded on
				  this mud.If you role play a character well, you will gain different
                  things depending on what the imms decide. When you create
                  a character, a bio (20 lines min) and desc (3 lines min) are
                  required. Your bio should contain your character's basic
                  story up to the age of 17 (starting age.) This should be your
                  guideline for playing your character. Decide when you start
                  a few basic, one word descriptions of your char's personality

                  Maybe thoughtfull, agressive, depressed, peppy, any type of
                  general stereotype is good. Once you start playing you can
                  develop this sterotype into a well rounded character with a
                  backround, a history, and a fully fleshed out emotional and
                  mental character. If you have any questions ask an Admin or
                  an enforcer.

&B9&z)  &BC&zUSTOM MODS -&w We do allow custom modifications of homes, etc.
                  Feel free to speak with an immortal, and be prepared
                  to role play a legitimate means of obtaining the
                  modification.

&B10&z) &BC&zLONES -   &w   Clones do not have ANY memory at all, they wake up 
                  and its like amnesia. The do not know who they are, besides 
				  they're name, and must be RPed as such. Killing a clone of a
                  person just for them being a clone of said person is
                  an offense and will not be tolerated.

&RNOTE:&c read "help rules2" for the rest of the rules.&w

1 RULES2~
&B11&z) &BS&zhip Descrption -   &w   The code enforces that each room have a room 
                                  description of a certain size. If anyone is caught making invalid
                                  decription( not a real and appropriate description of the room),
                                  the consquences are being "punished" and forfeiting the ship. This
                                  applies to the OWNER of the ship, no nessecarily the creator.

rely on auto-save to keep your character updated -- save frequently.

101 SETBOOT~
Syntax: setboot time <hour> <minute>
 	setboot manual <0|1>

The setboot command is useful for planning a reboot, (to save you from 
the trouble of all those echos :) ) and for the daily boot.  The manual
bit is used by the mud to determine whether the boot time was set by 
hand.  When the mud starts up, the boot time is set to 0600hrs (6am)
and the manual bit to 0.  If 'setboot time' is used, the mud sets the
manual bit to 1.  When it comes time to do the reboot, the mud checks
how long it has been running.  If it has been running less than 18 
hours and the reboot time has not been set manually, the reboot does
not take place (nor do the automatic warning echoes).

Echoes: when a scheduled reboot is coming up, the mud will send out
echoes to that effect.  The echoes start 30 minutes before the reboot
and are repeated at t minus 15, 10, 5, 4, 3, 2 and 1 minute(s).

Kword        check for item with keyword 'word'
G#####       check if player has ##### amount of gold
H####        check if player has #### amount of hitpoints

Special operators:
+ don't consume this component
@ decrease component's value[0], and extract if it reaches 0
# decrease component's value[1], and extract if it reaches 0
$ decrease component's value[2], and extract if it reaches 0
% decrease component's value[3], and extract if it reaches 0
^^ decrease component's value[4], and extract if it reaches 0
&& decrease component's value[5], and extract if it reaches 0
and ! will make the power fail if the caster is carrying that component.
 
Example: V1100 V+1101
The power will only succeed if the caster is carrying objects of vnums
1100 and 1101.  The object of vnum 1100 will get consumed by the power,
and the object of vnum 1101 will not.
 
With the decremental operators (@#$%^^&&), the object must have at least
a value of 1 in the respective location for the power to succeed.

created, new races discovered,  settlers have populate areas of the galaxy
previously thought unexplorable, and some ancient historical locations
destroyed. 

The Galactic Republic, headed by a council that makes and controls galactic
law, runs the Galaxy. This vast Republic is centred on the historical seat of
power, Coruscant, but have many smaller councils to govern provinces of the
galaxy. The armies of the Republic have been fairly inactive in the last 100
years after the remnants of the Imperials were removed and mutinous factions
have been brought under control.
 
The rise of the Corporations has been long coming, but the speed of their
growth recently has been enormous. Entire sectors are governed, patrol,
protected, and exploited by different Corporations. Some are more benevolent
than others, but all are after one thing: credits. With various companies,
guilds, and smaller planetary governments conflicting, there are always small
amounts of conflict, but they are not as quickly extinguished by the armies of
the Republic as they were in the past. 
 
The fall of the Jedi council has been well known for 250 years. The academy on
Yavin was destroyed by a small group of fallen Jedi, who came to hate Luke
Skywalker and wiped out the planet from existence with the force. As the Jedi
had put out the last known Sith cell, they had been fairly confident in their
safety until the attack. The effects of this attack were wide spread across
the galaxy, and put fear and suspicion in the hearts of all the peoples of the
galaxy. This destructive force had not been seen since the Death Star, and
severely damaged the place of all force users in the galaxy. The ability to
use the Force is now anathema, hated and despised by many, feared by all.

1 STRENGTH STR~
Strength (STR in your 'score') represents your character's physical power.
 
The most common concern with strength deals with how much your character
can carry.  For each additional point of strength  you gain an additional
amount of maximum carryable weight.  Any character with 20 strength can
carry 500kgs; Warriors and Rangers can have a maximum of 25 strength, and
can therefore carry up to 999kgs when their strength is at its maximum.
 
Strength also affects (among other things):
 
 - damage roll and hitroll; for each additional point of strength, each
   of these will increase
 
 - chances of success for bash, stun, bashdoor, shove and drag, and the
   ability to dual-wield heavier weapons
 
Strength is the prime attribute of warriors and rangers.

0 TALZ~
White-furred, four-eyed humanoids. The dense fur provides 
protection against cold on their home planet, Alzoc III. The 
larger pair of eyes is for night vision, and the other pair 
for use during the day. The smaller pair also allowed the Talz to 
see through glare shining off of the snow on their planet. They 
also have sharp claws on their hands and a proboscis through which 
they speak and feed. The Empire enslaved the Talz, because of their 
traits. 

How to play: Talz are calm, good-natured beings. They are tireless 
workers, which caused them to be enslaved. Most of them are unaware 
of a galactic civilization beyond their planet, as they live on their 
planet mining for the Imperials. Off world Talz are often thugs or 
Imperial workers, but the thugs are too gentle to actively bully 
others. They are usually found on fringe worlds, as the Talz who 
stray too far towards the Core are usually recaptured and enslaved.

The thief is a dark character which makes use of many skills often deemed
improper by the rest of society.  The skills of the thief reflect his way
of life, namely sneaking in the dark, picking locks, and attacking from

so don't be suprised if you are always under suspicion.  Thieves start off
fairly weak, but as they gain skills such as backstab and circle they soon
become dangerous foes.  A thief is always usefull when there is a lock

0 TICK~
Many of the actions in the game are based upon interval timers, including
combat, most autonomous monster actions, hp/force/move regeneration, power
duration, weather, and area resetting.
 
Of these timers, the hp/force/move regeneration timer is popularly called the
'tick'.  Ticks in the game average 30 seconds of real time, but the actual
amount varies randomly from 15 seconds to 45 seconds.
 
Area resetting happens roughly every 3 minutes if there are no characters in
in the area; less often (15 minutes) if any characters are present.  Also
note that objects lying on the ground will not be regenerated if anyone
is in the area when it resets.
 
Area resets are indicated by 'squeaking noises' just prior to the reset.

0 TRANDOSHAN TRANDOSHA DOSHA~
These humanoid reptiles are native to the planet Trandosha. They have long 
arms, which end in wide, splayed fingers. Their heads are blunt, with beady red 
eyes and a mouth full of sharp teeth. Their scales range in color from orange 
to ochre to brown. Much of their body can be regenerated if lost, so a 
Trandoshan can fight much harder without risk of permanent injury. Being a 
vicious, warlike race, the Trandoshans evolved into hunters, and were 
especially proficient at hunting Wookiees, which inhabited the nearby planet of 
Kashyyyk. It was a Trandoshan official who sold the idea of enslaving Wookiees 
rather than simply leveling Kashyyyk to the Empire.

-----Playing a Trandoshan-----
Trandoshans are, as a race, fairly beligerant. Not to say that every one is, but
they definately tend more towards mercenaries and soldiers than scientists or
diplomats. They have a deep rooted contempt for most other races bred into them,
believing that their strength makes them superior. Often found in seedy bars
picking fights or hunting the galaxy for exotic and deadly beasts, Trandoshans
are an intimidating lot.

0 TWI'LEK TWI'LEKS TWILEK~
Twi'lek is the species name of the humanoid aliens with twin head tentacles. 
They come from the planet Ryloth, located in a system in the Outer Rim. The 
Twi'lek language combines verbal components with subtle head-tail movements. 
With the meanings provided by the head-tail movements, Twi'leks can carry on 
private conversations in the midst of other species. Twi'leks live in vast city 
complexes located on the planets dark side. Each complex is autonomous, 
goverened by a head clan of five Twi'leks who jointly oversee production, 
trade, and other daily endeavours. As the technology level of Ryloth does not 
support spacefaring capabilities, the Twi'leks must depend on neighboring 
systems (such as Tatooine), pirates, smugglers, and merchants for their contact 
with the rest of the galaxy. They attract these ships with their chief export, 
ryll. The mineral ryll has legitimate medicinal uses, but it is also a popular 
and dangerously addictive recreational substance used in the Corporate Sector. 
One hazard the Twi'leks face on a regular basis is slavers, who come to their 
world to fill their ships with Twi'lek slaves.

-----Playing a Twi'lek-----
Twi'leks have an extremely segregated society. Twi'lek males fill many rolls,
the most respected of which are warriors, either hand-to-hand or pilots.
Those that truely run twi'lek society are the merchants. Merchants govern their
colonies, arrange exports and imports, and are the focus of most activity on
Ryloth. Females however, are expected to keep house and family, most not even
being allowed to leave the house. Twi'lek females are prized for their dancing
ability however, and many thousands of slaves are used as dancers by other races.
Most males that manage to leave Ryloth are traders, and females are almost
exclusively escaped slaves.

101 USEPROG~
Syntax: opedit [object] <command> [number] [use_prog] [percentage]
 
The use_prog is an objtrigger that can be used in object programs.  The
use_prog will be executed when the item is used.  To define what will
trigger the use_prog, here is a list:

* Wands - when you zap
* Staves - when you brandish
* Food/pills - when you eat
* Blood/fountains/drink containers - when you drink
* Lights/armour/weapons - when you wear/wield/hold
* Potions - when you quaff
* Pipes - when you smoke
 
When the use_prog is executed you will not see the standard 'use message'
(ie You quaff a violet potion). What you will will be any mpechoes placed
in the program.  Also, any mobprog commands can be used in use_prog (see 
MPCOMMANDS).

**NOTE** The use_progs on lights, armour, and weapons are executed BEFORE
the player wears/holds/wields any item. Therefore, a mpforce to remove the
item will not work in the use_prog.  You will have to use a wear trigger
to accomplish this.

101 USERS~
Syntax: users <host ip>
Syntax: users <playername>

USERS reports all of the visible users connected to the server, including users
in the process of logging in.
If used with an argument, it will show all users from that host ip.
Shortforms of host will work -- e.x. 205, or 205.113, etc.
Shortened names will also work.  e.x., users fre would show
Fredrick and Fred if they were on at the time.
The first number, (desc), is the descriptor number that this user is on.
The second number is the user's connected state.  (See CONSTATES)
The third number is the number of seconds the user has been idle.
The fourth number is the remote TCP port on the user's host machine.
Next is the user's character name, then the user's host address.
(Usually the IP number as name resolving is normally disabled.)

The FORCECLOSE command can be used to force a connect to close by its
descriptor number.

1 VENDOR VENDORS~
Personal vendors are now available to the public.
 
To obtain a vendor, simply go to any shop keeper, and use the command
'buyvendor.
 
This will produce to you a deed for a shopkeeper. Take this deed to the
room that you want, and use the command
'placevendor'.
 
This will create your shopkeeper. Simply give the shopkeeper the items your
want to sell.
 
To set the price of the item, type 'pricevendor <item> cost'. This will
make the item available to anyone to
buy.
 
To get your money from your shopkeeper, type 'collectcredits'. The
shopkeeper charges a 5% service fee.
 
NOTE: Selling items is IC. If you sell, say, a container called "Super mega
ultra blaster of death", and its a pouch, thats a valid reason for
retribution.
 
Also, you can have ONLY one vendor. If you buy another, your original will
be destroyed.

With a large bonus to strength and constition, the small wisdom penalty is

honor forbids the use of energy weapons in all but the most extreme cases.
Once befriended, a Wookiee will stay loyal for his or her entire life, which
can be as long as three hundred years.
Wookiees are among the galaxy's greatest warriors.  They are not, however, 
mearly large stupid beasts.  While the inability to speak basic often portrays
them as huge, unthinking animals, many are accomplished mechanics, engineers, 
and scientists.

-----Playing a Wookiee-----
Wookiee's evolved from ape-like creatures as hunters. They believe strongly in
honor and duty. The wookiee life-bond is an important part of their culture, it
is basically that if a wookiee's life is saved by another, then their life is
bound to their savior, they will do anything for them. Of course there are the
occasional renegade wookiee's, which generally rebel entirely against their
culture and come to despise honor and duty. Wookiee's tend towards light sided
personalities, and almost unanimously support the rebellion because of their
former enslavement by the empire. They fill many rolls, from pilots to warriors
to engineers, and are well rounded to any task.

Certain xsocials require that the target be at a certain level of arousal
before it can be performed on that person.
 
NOTE: you must be 18 years of age, in real life, before you can use these
commands, as they contain sexually explicit material.
 
The reciepient must also have used "setself legal" to acknowledge that they
are of legal age before the xsocials can be performed upon them.

0 ZABRAK~
Description 

Although native to the planet Iridonia, the Zabrak race learned about 
space travel very early in Old Republic history, having been provided 
the knowledge by Duros explorers. These humanoids share several 
characteristics with humans in regards to height, weight, and proportions, 
They are divided into several subspecies, characterized by the series
of horns atop their heads. They have a very high tolerance for pain, 
which came from not being able to treat wounds medically. 

Playing as a Zabrak: 

With a very high tolerance of pain, Zabraks make for excellent soldiers,
 mercenaries, and bounty hunters, but very poor medics and 
occupationists. They are very accepting of other cultures and 
governments, keeping their allegiences their own for the most part. As a 
race, they tend not to stray under the law, respecting the laws of trade 
and smugglings.

1 desctips descti desctips desctip 'description tips' desct~
This help file is intended to aid you in writing a proper physical
description for your character and is no way set in stone. These are just
some ideas and helpful guides to follow when writing a physical
description for your character.
 
Tips:
 
-Learn about the Race.
-Look for a picture through searches
-Keep your bio history in mind (for battle scars etc.)
 
Guides:
 
Generally, when people meet they try to look eye-to-eye. So when 
writing your description, start from the head and work your way
down.
 
Have pearly whites when you smile? Great! But try to avoid using
lines like, her teeth gleam brightly when she smiles.  This
sort of thing is best left for a pose/emote while Role Playing.
Perhaps, Her lips are very full and soft looking . They are
pouting gently over her gleaming white teeth. Although you
wouldnt normally see a person teeth unless theyre talking--in
the description it is ok to indicate something like this so for
the sake of RP so a person could take note and use it to
compliment the character ICly.
 
Try to be descriptive, not informative. If you look like your
brothers, don't talk about them in your description--I've never
seen them before. Have something disfiguring from the rest of your
species? Perhaps use something similar to, "The golden fur on his
right forearm ends abruptly revealing a patch of pale white skin"
 
Remember it doesnt have to be too long but if a picture paints
1000 words, you can at least use a few. Also know that it takes
practice. Looking at player and mob descriptions can be helpful
for gaining ideas as well.
 
Write a description when youre ready, dont make it a chore.

Mandalorians   Originally, the Mandalorian clans were led by the warlord
"Mandalore the First" and were ranked amongst the best fighters in the galaxy,
thriving for battle. They were known for their use of cutting-edge weaponry
and held to a strict code of honor. They were a gray-skinned warrior race.
These Mandalorians wore crusader armor that differed from one soldier to the
next. The Neo-Crusaders were led by "Mandalore the Ultimate" and started the
Mandalorian Wars. The Neo-Crusaders armor was more advanced and uniform-like
than their old armor. It came in many colors, though most were blue. Elites,
sergeants, and a few other ranks wore green. Captains (and other ranks) wore
red. Some other ranks wore yellow. Canderous Ordo, who would later become
Mandalore, wore a unique suit of silver and black armor.

0 'ugnaught ugnaughts'~
Description 

Ugnaughts are short, stout humanoids with elongated heads and alien facial
features. Gray hairs line down their faces, though they remain bald atop
their tanned-skin heads. Thriving in the very depths of machines and
ships, they are extraordinary mechanics, and act as a backbone for many
large operations- including the late Cloud City operation.

Playing as an Ugnaught 

Ugnaughts don't spend very much time with non-ugnaughts, so they remain
very antisocial with any creature that is not of their species. Although
they are fantastic mechanics, their race is not adapted to combat of any
kind, being more submissive than rebellious anyway.

0 verpine verpines~
Verpine are an advanced species of bipedal insectoids. Their thin, sticklike 
bodies have awkwardly articulated joints and chitinous shells. Two antennae jut 
from the sides of their heads, which have two large eyes and short snouts. The 
Verpine live in the Roche asteroid field, using great repulsor shells to keep 
occupied asteroids from crashing into each other and to deflect other bits of 
space debris. They are innate experts in most fields of technology, and their 
childlike fascinations with all types of machinery has served them well. They 
hollow out the asteroids for use as colonies, sealing them against space and 
filling them with all kinds of technological wonders. The Verpine have 
developed into expert starship builders. The Slayn & Korpil Corporation, named 
for two neighboring Verpine colonies, has been well known and respected since 
the days of the Old Republic. It was the Verpine who helped admiral ackbar 
design and build the B-Wing starfighters.

-----Playing a Verpine-----
Verpines widely inhabit the galaxy, they often leave their homes in asteroid
fields in search of new technologies to tinker with. Their driving goal in
life is generally the accumulation of knowledge and skill, which makes them
excellent engineers. They have an almost supernatural ability to figure out
what a machine does and how it works, and it causes them confusion that
other, less intelligent races, find it quite difficult. They are somewhat
awkward when dealing with other races, due to the fact that verpines believe
that the only true sense is touch, the others all have a delay of time
between the event and the comprehension of it, therefore they are almost
always touching those that they are in conversation with, and many other
races find this offensive.
