Here's the deal: At the moment, we have leaders for neither The New
Republic nor The Imperial Remnants. The leader of the imperials was killed
during an attack by a Jedi, and the leader of The New Republic was removed
for RP purposes.   Both positions are available.
 
Now, as to some of the recent issues with poor RP. It is in several help
files, it is in the mud rules, but I will explain it once
again:
 
"Commands" are generally OOC. Who, Whois, finger, info, clans, etc, these
are OOC. The information gained from these are to be used for OOC purposes
only.
 
Other commands, for example, radar, stat, look, practice, these are IC.
 
If you do not know whether a command would be considered IC or OOC, ask an
IMM, not other players. If one is not available, leave us mudmail or a
note on this board, and we will answer you. Until you receive an answer,
though, assume it is
OOC.
 
"Skills" are 100% IC. Any information or action done with these are to be
used for IC purposes only. "Gather Intelligence", for example, is an IC
way to discover a person's clan.

<continued from previous post>
 
IMM's are always considered OOC, no matter what, and any information gained
form them should be considered as such. If there is a problem with an IMM,
report it to myself or Erflink, or mail us at darkwarsmud@hotmail.com, and
we shall deal with it.

Further, the only channels that are to be considered OOC are: ooc, avatar,
music, ask, answer, osay, otell, and newbie. All others are IC. 

Only the text on an IC board is to be considered IC. Subject and Author are
OOC information, as has been stated several times.

If you experience any problems with people not properly RPing, please do
the following:

1. Politely point out what they are doing wrong, and offer a way to fix it,
IE: "Ketta, thats IC information. Please use chat instead of OOC."
2. If they persist and it does not affect you, IGNORE them. I will be
implementing code to ignore people soon, or turn off that
channel.
3. If they persis and it DOES affect you IC, and you cannot resolve it in
 
If you have any further questions/concerns, contact an IMM.

Want some easy money? (I know this isn't RP, *shrugs*)
If anyone wants to make an easy buck, they can do it by helping me out
I need single line room descriptors for stock rooms. 
The types are...
inside, city streets, fields, forests, hills, mountains, water, rough
water, under water, deserts, ocean floor, underground, starships
an example...
"The rolling hills are lightly speckled with violet wildflowers." 
--Please make sure to mention which section it fits in. 
I will pay 10000 credits per line, as long as they are good. 
E-mail them to darkwarsmud@hotmail.com
--(Be sure to include your character name) 
 
Thanks, 
    -Erflink

How about...
 
Improving the selection of items that are on offer for doing quests
Improving the selection of rooms it puts items in (They all seem to pop items
into the same 5 or 6 rooms, like Cockpit on Gamorr)
Have a way to get out of Coruscant Jail apart from going LD or getting someone
to let you out... a timer would be good.
Apart from that, thats all I can think up!

Hey, Camouflage works, BUT I cannot see my own items that I camouflage or wear
them. How are Defels that have smuggling supposed to see their items without
being a bounty hunter's see masking. ? I think it needs to be tweaked so that
the owners can see the items they camouflage.

I've discovered that you can grab a bountied mob without stunning them. While I
does benefit people trying to level. It makes it too easy. I also do not know
if it would be possible to grab players without  having to stun them. I think
this could cause some abuse.

a change to shipdesign that allows engineers to choose a stock design (ie
MC-90, ISD, YT-1300), the stock designs already haveing their rooms in place.
The ships when created would have a preset number of interior and exterior
"slots" based upon its class and #of rooms. The slots would start with their
default parts which can be replaced with engineer made parts, or store bought
parts. The parts would be used to provide the ship with hull, shields,
engines, generators, various weapons, weapon systems, computer systems, etc.
Those parts could then, during battle become damaged, external parts could
possibly even be targeted and hit with ions or lasers to be destroyed or
disabled.  This would allow for more realistic ships and would allow for veru
unique ship configurations, and would eliminate ships with outrageous stats.
