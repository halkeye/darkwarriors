Note on modules...   At present, a module may point to one hard code function,
most likely this function is shared to some extend by other modules. The
purpose of this hard code function may vary in any way, however, in theory one
should be able have as many soft code functions as desired incased within the
module. I set it up this way, because most likely the player will be
interacting with the modules via the soft code functions which builders will
create, where as the hard code function will provide back-end services to
modules. I would appreciate any constructive criticism on this matter.
 
(hard code)<----->(module)<----->(softcode)
     |             /|\/|\             |
    \|/             |  |             \|/
(database)<---.     |  |     (output/input)
     |        |     |  |
    \|/       |     |  '----(new instances)
(boot load)---|-----+---------->(templates)
              '-----|--------------' /|\
                 (admin)--------------'
 
This is somewhat more complicated of a layout than I had planned on drawing.
Softcode involves writing an interpreter and creating a scripting language.
Although I would like to use SQL for the database, a file system would suffice.
Basically admin functions create/modify templates and instances of modules.
Boot load is just that, it loads the modules up on boot.

* Checks to see if a mob is in the room, or the corpse is given to it?
 * if the mob is bound, then reward and dropped bounds,
* reward is based on olc list (mob vnum, corpse vnum, bounty alive, bounty
dead)
 *
* If the player enters the room and is bound by someone, and person is
bountied, pay out bounder and jail bounty.
 *
 * (Halkeye) OOC: found bound mobs, its easy
* (Halkeye) OOC: but for corpses, should it only be if they are given to the
guy right? or should he automaticly assume any corpses in a play
 * (Halkeye) OOC: and since when can you put like a corpse in a backpack?
 * (Cinna) OOC: he should assume that the corpses are for him
 * (Cinna) OOC: because who else are they going too?
* (Halkeye) OOC: yea .. well its kinda weird for a mob to just take your
corpses from you
* (Halkeye) OOC: and for that matter for you to pick up more than one corpse at
all

The galaxy is a much different place than before. 500 years have passed since
the famous Battle of Endor, and the eventual downfall of the galactic Empire.
The galaxy has had many hundreds of peaceful years, and there been much
galactic restoration and restructuring. There have been new technologies
created, new races discovered,  settlers have populate areas of the galaxy
previously thought unexplorable, and some ancient historical locations
destroyed. 
 
The Galactic Republic, headed by a council that makes and controls galactic
law, runs the Galaxy. This vast Republic is centred on the historical seat of
power, Coruscant, but have many smaller councils to govern provinces of the
galaxy. The armies of the Republic have been fairly inactive in the last 100
years after the remnants of the Imperials were removed and mutinous factions
have been brought under control.
 
The rise of the Corporations has been long coming, but the speed of their
growth recently has been enormous. Entire sectors are governed, patrol,
protected, and exploited by different Corporations. Some are more benevolent
than others, but all are after one thing: credits. With various companies,
guilds, and smaller planetary governments conflicting, there are always small
amounts of conflict, but they are not as quickly extinguished by the armies of
the Republic as they were in the past. 
 
The fall of the Jedi council has been well known for 250 years. The academy on
Yavin was destroyed by a small group of fallen Jedi, who came to hate Luke
Skywalker and wiped out the planet from existence with the force. As the Jedi
had put out the last known Sith cell, they had been fairly confident in their
safety until the attack. The effects of this attack were wide spread across
the galaxy, and put fear and suspicion in the hearts of all the peoples of the
galaxy. This destructive force had not been seen since the Death Star, and
severely damaged the place of all force users in the galaxy. The ability to
use the Force is now anathema, hated and despised by many, feared by all.

Remove all the areas except maybe coruscant (or something that is newer or
better).
Having all these sucky planets, well suck, The only good thing about them is
the trading thing and making money.
Removing them, pushes people towards each other so they run into eachother
more. and then install/create more areas as there are more planets...

I agree with removing many of them. I beleive that with a little work the
new(heh) tatooine could be used, and its custom. I also want to keep one or
two areas, Mon Cal specifically considering the work Saet's put into it.

I think that replacing the areas is a good idea.  I think that you should wait
until you have something to replace them with. If you think we have a low
player base now, wait until you start taking away things they can do and
places they can go. The ones we have stay because they hope to see it grow. If
they see it shrink, they're gone. I think it's best to replace one area with
another once it's ready. That way they see that Kashyyyk, for example, is
gone, but in it's place is this wonderful new world they have never seen.
That's my opinion.  I hope you understand.   Alveka

I haven't been able to code lately because well, school is more important.
So, do you want what I have thus far Greven? It's not much, and it's not
finished, but it's better than nothing?My only request is that if this codebase
were ever released, my code not be included in that release.
In my push to make things fully scriptable, I've thought up something that may
be of interest.
I was thinking of how to make an intramud communication standard for objects,
which is a precursor to server clustering and scripting.
I believe that a message queue similar to that which Windows uses might work.
Let me know what you think.

1) Auto short description of players
* Would be based on topmost layer of eq (probably just 2 or 3 wear locations)
* Complextion (did we take that out?)
* Height (?)
* Race
* Gender
* etc
 
2) Introduction system, reversed
* Instead of introducing yourself, you are able to name people you meet
lets say I come up to a human male wearing a jacket, he says his name is joe, i
can name him joe so from how on i see joe. This way on channels like chat
instead of no names, you can recognize people.
Couldn't figure out enough of the details at work, but there are alot of up and
downsides to this.
Discuss?

3) Bug tracking system (revisited). Trac is actually a really cool system, you
can do bug tickets and stuff. http://svn.kodekoan.com/cgi-bin/trac.cgi is the
one i have setup for one of my projects (barely setup at that).

that command/skill lets you build ships in rooms you can't take off.
There would be tricks to still launch the ship, and i don't know if repulsors
work or not here.
 
Anyways, just changed the code to let you build ships in shipyard installations
(ones that have planets)
but they could have ships scattered throught them that way then.

rework installations completly
have a grid of x by y demension
then have it so any rooms in tehre can be created / destroyed
rooms have to be created within the grid, and you can select the direction
that way, to be fun, bombs can destroy passageways, and someone will have to
come in and redo the hallway.
and even planting charges and stuff and blow up passageways to different
important rooms (such as no long able to control the shield).
trying to think of more ways to tie into the dark warriors namesake.
Also think we should make an arena asteroid and make it iC, and do training
that way and stuff.
and dump all dropped objects in a room outside the arena doors.
 
(too tired to actually try to respace this out and stuff)
